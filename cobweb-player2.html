      "description": "Cobweb, the 2023 American horror thriller, emerges as a promising plus to
      the genre, showcasing the directorial debut of Samuel Bodin. Written by Chris St. Thomas Devlin, a
      script that once graced the prestigious 2018 The Black List, the shoot boasts an ensemble cast
      featuring Lizzy Caplan, Woody Norman, Cleopatra Coleman, and Marcus Antoniu Starr. At its core, Cobweb
      revolves around the unsettling experiences of eight-year-old Peter, portrayed by Woody Norman. Plagued
      by a constant tapping noise emanating from within his bedroom wall, Peter's apprehensions are met with
      dismissals from his parents, portrayed by Lizzy Caplan and Antony Starr. They attribute the sounds to
      his vivid imagination, yet Peter's conviction that they are withholding a sinister secret only if
      deepens. Driven by escalating fear, he embarks on a quest to unveil the hidden truths, inadvertently
      unearthing a disturbing family mystery that has remained indistinct for far too long. The film's debut
      pronounced its arrival on July 21, 2023, with a limited theatrical release in the United States by
      Lionsgate.",
