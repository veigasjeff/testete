        "description": " Neeyat is a 2023 Indian Hindi-language mystery thriller film directed by
        Anu Menon and produced by Ronnie Screwvala, Siddharth Roy Kapur, and Manish Mundra. The film stars
        Vidya Balan, Ram Kapoor, Rahul Bose, Shahana Goswami, and Harshvardhan Rane. The film follows a
        detective who investigates the murder of a billionaire at his birthday party. The take opens with a
        scene of a lavish birthday political party being held for Ashish Kapoor (Ram Kapoor), a wealthy
        businessman. The party is attended by Kapoor's close friends and family, including his wife, Rekha
        (Vidya Balan), and his daughter, Anya (Shahana Goswami). In the middle of the party, Kapoor is found
        dead in his swim pool. The police are called to investigate, and they quickly rule out the possibility
        of an accident. They believe that Kapoor was murdered, and they start to suspect his closest friends
        and family. The detective assigned to the case is Mira Rao (Vidya Balan), a acute and intuitive
        investigator. She quickly realizes that everyone at the party has something to hide. Rekha is a
        controlling and manipulative woman who is having an affair with Kapoor's best friend, Siddharth (Rahul
        Bose). Anya is a rebellious teenager who is struggling with her parents' expectations. And Siddharth
        is a ruthless businessman who is willing to do anything to protect his own interests. As Mira
        investigates, she uncovers a web of secrets and lies. She learns that Kapoor was not the saint that
        everyone thought he was. He was a remorseless businessman who had made many enemies. And he had a dark
        past that he had kept hidden from his family and friends. Mira eventually discovers who killed Kapoor,
        but the truth is more complicated than she ever imagined. The murder was not just about revenge. It
        was also about power and control. And it had far-reaching consequences that would change the lives of
        everyone involved. Mira Rao is a skilled detective who is able to see through the lies and deception
        of the people she interviews. She is also a compassionate woman who is able to empathize with the
        victims of the crime.",
