      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <p class="font-bold mb-2">Why is a Video is not loading?</p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-6">
      The easiest and fastest way to fix browser not playing videos is to ensure that browser is completely updated and restarted. If updating doesn't work, try clearing your cache.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-6">Another reason why videos won’t play is because your browser is outdated. Updating your browser to the latest version should resolve the problem, since the updated browser may have already been optimized and fixed for previously reported bugs.</p>
      <p class="font-bold mb-2">Why isn't there a HD version of this video?</p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-6">
      The next factor you need to look at is the quality of the video you are playing. Some videos might be too big for your internet connection, so your browser will have trouble loading it.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-6">
To adjust the video quality:</p>
<p class="text-gray-500 mb-6">
1.Click the gear icon located at the bottom of the video you want to play.</p>

<p class="text-gray-500 mb-6">2.Choose the lowest quality available to check if the video will play.</p>
<p class="text-gray-500 mb-6">
3.If it plays , try raising the quality bit by bit until you find the highest quality your internet connection is capable of streaming.
      </p>
      <p class="font-bold mb-2">
      Why is the sound distorted?
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-6">
      The cause of distortion is the overload of amplifying a signal. A loudspeaker or a microphone has a transducer that converts energy into another form of energy. In this case, it transforms electrical signals into mechanical movements to create sound.
      </p>

      <p class="font-bold mb-2">
      Why is the Video stuttering, buffering or randomly stopping?
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-6">
      However, the cause of buffering almost always comes down to insufficient internet bandwidth — the file can't download fast enough to keep pace with playback, and it pauses to buffer. This can be due to: A slow/unstable internet connection. Lack of available bandwidth.
