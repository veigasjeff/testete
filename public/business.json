    "description1": "Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has cancelled the SME IPO of Trafiksol ITS Technologies and asked the company to refund the money to the investors for alleged questionable dealings with a ‘shell entity’. The IPO which was open for subscription between September 10 and 12, 2024 oversubscribed 345.65 times. The issue was priced at the upper end of the price band (Rs 70 per share) and Rs 44.87 crore was raised through the issue. After the closure of the issue and allotment of shares, a complaint was received by SEBI and BSE from the Small Investors’ Welfare Association – SIREN which alleged that the objects of the issue by the company included purchase of software valued at Rs 17.70 crore from a vendor which had questionable financials and failed to file its annual financial statements with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The BSE then in consultation with the SEBI deferred the listing of the shares of the company. “Based on the findings, it is reasonable to conclude that the third-party vendor (TPV) in question is a ‘shell entity’. The TPV's office was found locked during a site inspection, and its financial statements for FY22 to FY24, submitted in response to allegations, were obtained under questionable circumstances as it was signed by the auditor on same day it was submitted to the BSE by the MB (merchant banker),” Sebi said in its 16-page order. This was one day after BSE in consultation with Sebi put on hold the listing of the shares of the company and initiated an examination. “Further, the client list and credentials of its directors, presented in its profile, were fabricated. Apart from the above, the ex-director’s sworn statement that the company was sold for a nominal sum of Rs. 20,000 reinforces the conclusion that the TPV lacked the technical expertise and operational capacity to execute a complex project such as ICCC software,” Sebi said. Further, the client list and credentials of its directors, presented in its profile, were fabricated. Apart from the above, the ex-director’s sworn st",
    "description2": "atement that the company was sold for a nominal sum of Rs 20,000 reinforces the conclusion that the TPV lacked the technical expertise and operational capacity to execute a complex project such as ICCC software, Sebi order said. “The question of whether the quotation from the TPV was part of a scheme to divert IPO proceeds will remain moot due to the events triggered by the complaint and subsequent regulatory intervention. This, however, does not take away the fact that the company relied on a sham entity and participated in a cover-up when the credentials of the TPV were being examined,” Sebi said. “I cannot also lose sight of the fact that the funds of the investors who have been allotted shares in the IPO have remained locked-in for close to three months now. Therefore, the issue cannot be put on hold till the other findings of the Investigation are adjudicated,” Sebi Wholetime Director Ashwani Bhatia said in the order. Balancing these considerations, the most prudent course of action is to direct the company to refund the money raised through the IPO, Sebi said. The company may approach the market afresh after the ongoing proceedings initiated by SEBI are concluded and subject to any directions issued therein, it said. Incorporated in March 2018, Noida-based Trafiksol says it offers comprehensive solutions for intelligent transportation systems and automation, including software development, consultancy and supply services. \"Our offerings encompass ready-made and customized software solutions, operating systems, business applications, and computer games across all platforms,\" it said in the IPO prospectus. Jitendra Narayan Das is the chairman and MD of the company. The company made a revenue of Rs 65.81 crore and a net profit of Rs 12.01 crore for FY2024. The primary market had witnessed a flood of SME IPOs with oversubscription of up to 2,000 times in one instance and huge listing premium in the recent months. This had prompted many small entities to go for SME IPOs, forcing the Sebi and exchanges to tighten the SME IPO norms.",

    "description1": "US and China have got into fresh tit-for-tat trade restrictions. After the US announced export restrictions on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips, China on Tuesday retaliated by banning exports of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials to the US. The fresh trade war assumes significance as “connecting economies” who are perceived as neutral and do not fall into the US or China camps, such as India, have benefited from the geo-political tensions between US and China since Donald Trump’s first term. As China’s export share in the US saw a decline from 2019, countries like Vietnam, Mexico and India have witnessed an increase in export opportunities to the US. China’s export ban on Tuesday of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials follows it’s earlier move to partly restrict exports of strategically important materials by asking exporters to apply for licences. The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the export ban after the US expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips. In a speech earlier this year, First Deputy Managing Director at International Monetary Fund (IMF) Gita Gopinath had said that evidence suggested that non-aligned countries (such as India) did not play an important role serving as connectors between rival blocs during the Cold War — likely because they had a much smaller economic footprint and global supply chains were not yet developed. But today these countries have greater economic and diplomatic heft and are much more integrated into the global economy and their role as connectors this time around can help attenuate some of the costs of fragmentation. Gopinath had compared current trade fragmentation with that of the Cold War period stating t",
    "description2": "hat trade between the rival Western and Eastern blocs was significantly depressed during the Cold War, relative to trade within these blocs. “Thus far, today’s fragmentation is not significantly different from the initial years of the Cold War. However, compared to the average ‘between-bloc trade shortfall’ during the entire Cold War period, fragmentation so far is an order of magnitude smaller,” she said. Explaining her cause of concern during the current period, Gopinath said, trade fragmentation is much more costly this time around because unlike the start of the Cold War when goods trade to GDP was 16 per cent, now that ratio is 45 per cent. “Moreover, while back then countries within a bloc were taking off trade restrictions, now we are in an environment of growing protectionism with several countries turning inward. The potential role of non-aligned countries in the current trade frictions also makes the situation today different from the Cold War experience,” she said. Notably, India is planning to increase the funding outlay for chip manufacturing incentive policy to $15 billion from the $10 billion it had committed for the first phase. Tata is building India’s first commercial fabrication plant along with its Taiwanese partner Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC) for a cost of more than Rs 91,000 crore. The government has also approved three assembly and testing plants, which are called ATMP and OSAT in chip parlance. The assembly and testing plants are less complex than the semiconductor fabrication plant. The first of these three plants was approved in June 2023, and is being built by US-based Micron Technology. Tata is building an assembly plant in Assam while the third facility is being built by CG Power and Industrial Solutions of the Murugappa Group, in partnership with Renesas Electronics of Japan. &nbsp;",

    "description": "The progress on the Production-Linked Incentive  scheme, which covers 14 sectors, and the learnings from each, has prompted deliberations to tweak the formats of some to optimise tangible outcomes, renew some, and increase the outlay in yet others.",
    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/PLI.jpg",
    "description1": "If employment generation is used as a metric, six of the 14 Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes including textiles, solar modules, IT hardware, automobiles, advanced chemical cells (ACC), and specialty steel, are relatively in the slow lane. Others, including food processing and mobile phone manufacturing, appear to be well on track to meet the targets set at the time the schemes were announced. The progress on the PLI scheme, which covers 14 sectors, and the learnings from each, has prompted deliberations to tweak the formats of some to optimise tangible outcomes, renew some, and increase the outlay in yet others. The government views PLI schemes to be crucial for India on two fronts: one, to leverage public funding to scale up the domestic manufacturing base such as to increase India’s contribution to the global supply chains, and second, to create lakhs of direct and indirect jobs. The scale up in the employment outcomes from these schemes, according to at least two government officials The Indian Express spoke with, can be fully leveraged once the supply chain is established and the benefits of the schemes percolates down to smaller suppliers. These benefits, they said, are beginning to show in sectors such as mobile manufacturing and food processing. They also point to the need to calibrate employment outcomes only after a scheme gathers a certain critical mass. The potential is big. A note by rating agency Crisil from February 2024 said the scheme could drive industrial capital expenditure of Rs 3-3.5 lakh crore over its duration and constitute 8-10 per cent of total capex in key industrial sectors over the next three to four years. The industry has, however, complained of some niggling issues in the scheme for various sectors — there range from stringent eligibility norms, access to Chinese machinery and technicians, and import tariffs in some cases. The initial challenge The PLI schemes for many sectors are a big task by all means, as a domestic manufacturing industry has to be developed from scratch, since India has traditionally not had a footprint there. This could pose an initial challenge to employment generation, as companies in some sectors t",
    "description2": "ake time to set up manufacturing operations. The PLI scheme in sectors like solar modules and ACC allow for a commissioning period of one-and-a-half to three years. But some schemes have seen early initial traction. For instance, mobile phone manufacturing. Before the PLI scheme, India was a net importer of phones for domestic consumption. After the scheme, as companies like Apple ramped up assembly in the country, virtually all phones sold in the country are made in, with in India. In fact, India exported smartphones worth around $15 billion in 2023-24. In several PLI schemes, the initial beneficiaries of incentives are likely going to be bigger companies. In mobile phone manufacturing, the biggest beneficiary so far has been Apple. However, the government’s bet is initial support to these enterprises will trickle down to the overall supply chain, and spur the ancillary industry. This will allow input makers (who may not directly benefit from PLI incentives) to set up shop in India to service companies that receive the incentives. This could further boost employment. For example, according to Apple’s suppliers’ list for 2023, at least 14 of its suppliers were from India, a number which was virtually zero before Apple started assembling iPhones in India. The idea with PLI schemes – the support for which ranges from three to seven years – is also to get a certain critical mass in a sector, so that when incentives are withdrawn, the sector remains competitive on an export parity basis. Critics, however, argue that the scheme is akin to subsidisation and may not result in competitiveness, especially once the incentives are over. Review of the PLI scheme The government is in active discussion with stakeholders as it reviews the progress of the PLI schemes in the 14 sectors, especially those like textiles, advanced chemistry battery cell, solar modules, and automobiles, where progress has been slow. The IT hardware PLI scheme was recently upgraded with an increased outlay, with discussions around renewing other schemes, such as that for drones, learnt to be also under consideration. The government could also tinker with eligibility criteria in schemes such as textiles.",

    "description1": "In a startling revelation, India now tops the list for mobile malware attacks globally, surpassing the United States and Canada, with a disappointing step-up from its previous third-place ranking, according to a report. The Zscaler ThreatLabz 2024 Mobile, IoT, and OT Threat Report analysed a dataset comprising over 20 billion threat-related mobile transactions and associated cyber threats, between June 2023 to May 2024. \"India has become the top global target for mobile malware attacks, accounting for 28 per cent of the total, surpassing the United States (27.3 per cent) and Canada (15.9 per cent). This significant jump from its 3rd place ranking last year underscores the critical need for Indian enterprises to adopt robust security measures, especially amid the rapid digital transformation and increasing cyber threats,\" the report said. With nearly half of mobile attacks being trojans (malware that tricks users into downloading and running malicious software), the financial sector is particularly vulnerable. The report revealed a 29 per cent increase in banking malware attacks and a staggering 111 per cent rise in mobile spyware attacks. \"Most financially motivated malware attacks are highly capable of bypassing Multifactor Authentication (MFA) and frequently leverage phishing vectors, such as fake login pages for different financial institutions, social media sites, and crypto wallets,\" it said. Phishing attempts targeting mobile customers of major Indian banks, such as HDFC, ICICI, and Axis banks, have increased, according to ThreatLabz analysts. Thes",
    "description2": "e clever attacks deceive mobile users into disclosing critical bank information by using phoney banking websites that closely mimic the real ones, it said. Previously, similar tactics were used to spread Android-based phishing malware through fake card update sites, leading to widespread financial fraud. The Indian postal service has also become a target for attackers. Using SMS messages, they direct mobile users to phishing sites that prompt them to input credit card details. These fraudulent schemes often exploit common scenarios like missing packages and incomplete delivery addresses, capitalising on the urgency created by such messages, the report noted. \"Legacy systems and unprotected IoT/ OT (Internet of Things/Operational Technology) environments are becoming prime targets for cybercriminals. We see a significant rise in hacking campaigns targeted at these environments. \"It is necessary for Indian enterprises to adopt a robust zero-trust security framework to secure their core operational environments. This will not only protect critical systems but also ensure business continuity in an increasingly connected world,\" said Suvabrata Sinha, CISO-India, Zscaler. The report also indicated a concerning global trend, with over 200 malicious applications discovered on the Google Play Store and a 45 per cent year-over-year increase in IoT malware transactions, underscoring the pervasive nature of cyber threats today. On a positive note, India has improved its ranking as a malware origin point, moving from 5th to 7th place in the APAC (Asia-Pacific) region.",

    "description1": "IN A step that would mark the first major restructuring of tax rates under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) seven years after its rollout, a special rate of 35 per cent could be carved out for demerit (sin) goods such as aerated beverages, cigarettes, tobacco and related products. At a meeting on Monday, ahead of the GST Council meeting on December 21, the Group of Ministers (GoM) on rate rationalisation finalised its report with this recommendation of a special rate, in addition to proposing a slew of rate tweaks for over 148 items including readymade garments. The proposed hike in GST rates for sin goods, from the current highest slab of 28 per cent, would help the Centre and the states to make up for the loss from other rate cuts for common-use items, officials said. The current four-slab GST structure - of 5 per cent, 12 per cent, 18 per cent and 28 per cent - will continue for the medium term, a state finance minister said. Among other rate change proposals, the GoM, headed by Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary, has suggested levying 5 per cent GST on readymade garments priced up to Rs 1,500; 18 per cent for those priced at Rs 1,500-10,000; and 28 per cent for garments costing above Rs 10,000. “The GoM has proposed raising the rates for tobacco and related products, and aerated beverages to 35 per cent. It will be a special rate and will help in minimising the revenue loss impact from the other rate changes,” a state finance minister, who is part of the GoM, told The Indian Express. The GoM has also proposed hiking rates on other high-end items such as cosmetics, watches and shoes. With this, the indirect tax regime would transition towards a regime where taxation gets linked to the pricing of the product and hence, a greater incidence would be on those who buy luxury and high-end items. The GST Council is scheduled to meet in Jaisalmer on December 21, where it will also take up the key proposal of GST on life and health insurance premiums. The premiums paid by seni",
    "description2": "or citizens for health insurance and premiums paid by all for term life insurance are likely to be exempted. For other citizens, health insurance cover till Rs 5 lakh is likely to be exempted and the existing rate of 18 per cent will be charged for health insurance cover over Rs 5 lakh. At its meeting in October, the GoM had suggested GST rejig for several items and proposed cutting rates for some items such as packaged water above 20 litres (5 per cent from 18 per cent), bicycles priced less than Rs 10,000 (5 per cent from 12 per cent) and exercise notebooks (5 per cent from 12 per cent). Shoes costing above Rs 15,000 and wristwatches above Rs 25,000 are likely to be shifted to the highest slab of 28 per cent GST from 18 per cent. Separately, the GoM on compensation cess, headed by Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary, also held its meeting on Monday and sought an extension of six months to submit its report to the GST Council. This GoM, which includes members from Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, was mandated to submit its report by December 31. The GoM is looking at the legal implications of removal of the cess - levied on sin and luxury goods such as cars, tobacco, over and above the existing highest rate of 28 per cent. “There is time till March 2026 to take a decision regarding the levy of the cess. So it was felt that a detailed discussion should happen, and so more time will be sought for submission of the report,” the minister said. The compensation cess was proposed to be levied for five years after the rollout of GST, till June 2022, to compensate states for revenue loss. In 2022, the Council decided to extend the levy till March 2026 to repay the interest and principal amount of the Rs 2.69 lakh crore of loans taken in 2021-2022 to pay off states' revenue loss during Covid years. At its meeting on September 9, the Council decided to set up a GoM to decide the future course of the cess.",

    "description1": "India’s largest airline IndiGo has filed a case in the Delhi High Court against automobile major Mahindra &amp; Mahindra’s (M&amp;M) electric mobility arm—Mahindra Electric Automobile (MEAL)—for using the airline’s identifier code 6E in the name of its recently unveiled electric vehicle BE 6e. IndiGo has the registration for the “6E” trademark and uses it extensively in its branding and advertising. “The ‘6E’ mark is an integral part of IndiGo’s identity for the past 18 years and is a registered trademark that holds strong global recognition. The ‘6E’ mark, whether standalone or in its variants and formative forms, is extensively used by IndiGo for its offerings and for goods and services provided in collaboration with trusted partners. Any unauthorised use of the “6E” mark, whether standalone or in any form, constitutes an infringement of IndiGo’s rights, reputation, and goodwill. IndiGo is committed to taking all necessary and appropriate steps to safeguard its intellectual property and brand identity,” the airline said in a statement.

It differs fundamentally from IndiGo’s ‘6E’, which represents an airline, eliminating any risk of confusion. The distinct styling further emphasizes their uniqueness,” M&amp;M said, adding that the trade mark registration filed by the MEAL is specifically for the vehicle class. “The Company and MEAL has taken on board the concerns that InterGlobe Aviation Limited (‘IndiGo’) have to infringement of their goodwill, which was not our intention. The Company and MEAL are engaged in discussions with them to find an amicable solution,” the automobile company said. The case came up for hearing before the Delhi High Court on Tuesday, and is now likely to come up for hearing next week. The starting price for the BE 6e is Rs 18.90 lakh and it will be launched in phased manner from January end. MEAL expects to start deliveries towards the end of February or early March.",

    "description1": "The rupee recovered from its all-time low level and settled for the day with gains of just 3 paise at 84.69 (provisional) against the US dollar in a range-bound trade on Tuesday, amid a positive trend in domestic equities. Forex traders said the rupee has been on a downtrend largely on the back of Donald Trump's rhetoric on BRICS currency, political instability in the Eurozone, weaker domestic macroeconomic indicators and unabated foreign portfolio outflows. US President-elect Trump on Saturday threatened a 100 per cent tariff on BRICS nations if they act to undermine the US dollar. Moreover, market participants are also awaiting cues from the upcoming RBI monetary policy on December 6, which will likely focus on balancing inflation and growth. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 84.75 and moved in a narrow range and touched an intra-day high of 84.64 and an all-time low of 84.76 against the greenback. On Monday, the rupee depreciated 12 paise to close at an all-time low of 84.72 against the dollar. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading lower by 0.18 per cent at 106.25. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, rose by 1.11 per cent to USD 72.63 per barrel in futures trade. Meanwhile, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary on Monday said in Parliament that the rupee remains one of the best-pe",

One of the main reasons for the depreciation of INR has been the broad-based strength of the USD, he said. \"During CY 2024, Dollar Index has increased by about 4.8 per cent till November 19, 2024. More recently, the Dollar Index touched 108.07 on November 22, 2024, its highest in more than a year, exerting pressure on emerging market currencies,\" he said. Further, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty surrounding US elections results also added to the headwinds. The depreciation of a currency is likely to enhance export competitiveness, which in turn impacts the economy positively. On the other hand, depreciation may raise the prices of imported goods. He further said, the RBI monitors key developments across the globe which may have an impact on USD-INR exchange rate. On the domestic equity market front, the 30-share benchmark index Sensex closed 597.67 points, or 0.74 per cent higher, at 80,845.75. The Nifty rose 181.10 points, or 0.75 per cent, to settle at 24,457.15. Traders said the persistent selling pressure by foreign funds added further strain on the currency. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital markets on Monday, as they offloaded shares worth Rs 238.28 crore, according to exchange data.",

    "description1": "Japanese firms are keen to set up semiconductor units in India and they have all the expertise and specialisation to partner with domestic firms, Deloitte has said. It also said that skilled workforce, funds and continuation of support measures are key to push growth of the semiconductor sector in India. Japanese firms are \"super enthusiastic\" about India, Shingo Kamaya, Deloitte AP and SRT Leader, Deloitte Japan said. In July, Japan became the second Quad partner after the US to sign an agreement with India for the joint development of the semiconductor ecosystem and maintain the resilience of its global supply chain. The two countries signed the memorandum for semiconductor design, manufacturing, equipment research, talent development and to bring resilience in the semiconductor supply chain. With around 100 semiconductor manufacturing plants, Japan is among the top five countries to have a semiconductor ecosystem. Japan houses companies that are global leaders in raw form of semiconductor wafers, chemical and gases, lenses that are used in chip manufacturing equipment, and display technologies. India aspires to have 10 semiconductor manufacturing plants in 10 years. \"Given the technology, given the specialization, there is no better partner ",
    "description2": "to get on to developing such an ambitious and a critical ecosystem of semiconductor than Japan,\" Rohit Berry, President - Strategy, Risk and Transactions, Deloitte India, said. He said that the semiconductor story in the country is not just about setting up one factory, but it is about that entire ecosystem. \"And that is where many Japanese companies who have set up such ecosystems in Japan or in any other places are going to be absolutely critical to set it up (in India). So this is the vision. This is a grand plan. This is the investment. This is the commitment,\" he added. Berry also said that developing the right kind of partnerships between Indian and Japanese firms are fundamental for the growth of the sector. \"This is not a one year game, it's not a two year game. This will basically benefit us and Japan for generations,\" he noted. He also emphasised that the government incentive program on a sustained basis will also be a key factor for the sector's growth in India. When asked if Japanese firms are looking for any specific support measures from states, he said that a \"centre-state partnership, together with the private and Japanese partnership, all four of them coming together will be a prerequisite to create a once in a lifetime setup\".",

    "description1": "Home prices are on the rise in India despite high interest rates in the banking system and inflation. The All-India Home Price Index (HPI) of the Reserve Bank of India rose by 4.34 per cent to 322 as of September 2024 as against 308.6 in September 2023, indicating that price rise is continuing across the metros, according to Reserve Bank of India data. HPI has gone up by nearly 67 per cent in the last ten years from 193.05 in 2014-15 amid the pandemic, high inflation and interest rates. The annual HPI growth varied widely across the cities, ranging from a high growth of 8.76 per cent (Bengaluru) to a decline of (-)2.0 per cent (Kanpur). On sequential (quarter-on-quarter) basis, all-India HPI decreased by 0.1 per cent in September 2024-25. Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Kolkata and Chennai recorded a sequential rise in house prices during the latest quarter, RBI data shows. Home price index for Mumbai rose by 2.95 per cent to 303.62 in September 2024 as against 294.92 a year ago, Delhi increased by 3.31 per cent to 350.40 from 339.16 and Bengaluru by 8.76 per cent to 360.11 from 331.08. The RBI’s home index is based on transaction-level data received from the registration authorities in top ten major cities. Average housing prices across the top eight markets in India rose 11 per cent year-on-year at Rs 11,000 per sq ft during Q3 of 2024, led by sturdy demand and positive market sentiments, industry body CREDAI said. Interestingly, average housing prices have increased for the 15th consecutive quarter since 2021. All the eight major cities saw an annual increase in housing prices with Delhi NCR witnessing the highest rise at 32 per cent, followed by Bengaluru at 24 per cent rise during the quarter. After registering record high sales over the last two years, the demand momentum across the top cities is stabilizing. Nevertheless, with anticipation of healthy residen",
    "description2": "tial activity in the last quarter, 2024 is likely to end on a strong note, it said. However, overall unsold inventory continued to witness a quarterly drop for the third consecutive quarter, led by healthy uptake in housing units. At the end of September 2024, unsold inventory stood at over 10 lakh housing units across the eight major cities, with Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) accounting for a majority at about 40 per cent share. Unsold units in Hyderabad saw a modest dip on a sequential basis despite a yearly increase of about 28 per cent. “The ongoing rise in housing prices is another validation of positive homebuyer sentiments and the highly conducive nature of the real estate market. We are seeing more and more aspirational homebuyers come to the fore – resulting in bigger homes that are also being reflected in the rise in prices as homes continue to get more expansive, truly reflecting the current market dynamics and consumer preferences,” said Boman Irani, President of CREDAI National. \"While the housing market is gradually stabilizing, the outlook for the residential segment remains positive supported by strong underlying market fundamentals. Developers are recalibrating their strategies, particularly in the price-sensitive segments, by offering compact size units,” said Badal Yagnik, Chief Executive Officer, Colliers India. “We expect this robust momentum to continue going into the new year and are hopeful of rate cuts in the impending future,” Irani said. “Although average housing prices have continued to increase steadily, witnessing a 11 per cent YoY growth during Q3 2024, the likely easing of monetary policy and anticipated repo rate cuts can potentially bring financial relief to homebuyers in the near term. Moreover, flexible payment plans and freebies to attract homebuyers will continue to aid in residential sales momentum,” Yagnik said.",

Officials confirmed that whilst initially available only at Delhi airport, the service has expanded to 31 international airports, including Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Cochin and Ahmedabad.Officials indicated that whilst the programme mirrors the US global entry programme, it has been adapted for Indian requirements. This initiative followed the US's offer to include India in its trusted travellers programme. The US Global Entry offers precheck benefits and expedited US Customs and Border Protection screening for international travellers entering the US with valid documentation.Officials familiar with the development told ET that the Global Entry Programme (GEP), by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), registered 1,491 individuals in August and 515 in September.

    "description1": "PAN 2.0: The Modi government has approved a new PAN 2.0 project and the first question that comes to the mind of taxpayers is, should they apply for the upgraded PAN Card under PAN 2.0? A free application option for a new PAN will be available for those needing to correct or update their details, such as name or date of birth. It’s important to note that the Income Tax Department has issued a statement confirming that current PAN cardholders need not mandatorily obtain a new PAN under the PAN 2.0 initiative. Should you replace old PAN with new PAN Card under PAN 2.0?Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code. Experts believe that the updated PAN card design with PAN 2.0 will reduce fraud risks through its integrated QR code whilst enabling quick verification.What are the benefits of PAN Card with QR Code?Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services - Financial Services told ET, \"Upgrading to the new PAN card design with a QR code is a proactive step for users to safeguard their identity and financial information. It helps reduce the likelihood of falling prey to fraudulent activities.\"Supporting this perspective, Ankit Ratan, CEO & Co-founder, Signzy - an online identity verification and customer onboarding company told ET, \"Under the PAN 2.0 initiative, the entire process of PAN application has been digitized. This enables provision of seamless PAN authentication and validation services to various organisations, including financial institutions, banks, and governmental bodies at both central and state levels.\"Also Read | PAN 2.0 FAQs answered! Will your PAN Card change, will it have a new number? Income Tax Department releases top 10 pointsAccording to Babbar, the QR code integration with PAN Card offers several advantages to taxpayers:Strengthened Security Features: The incorporation of QR code technology in the new PAN card significantly reduces vulnerability to duplication or alteration. The encrypted personal information within the QR code is accessible solely to authorised personnel with specific software. This security measure prevents fraudsters from modifying names and photographs whilst retaining the original PAN number. Financial institutions ",
    "description2": "can utilise the QR code to authenticate the printed information.Efficient Authentication Process: Identity verification becomes streamlined through the QR code scanning feature on the updated PAN card. The immediate verification process serves as protection against identity theft and impersonation. This functionality proves particularly valuable during financial transactions by reducing errors and fraudulent activities.Current Information Maintenance: The upgraded PAN card ensures user details conform to the Income Tax Department's latest formatting requirements.Regulatory Adherence: Users who obtain the redesigned PAN card align with the government's updated identification protocols, supporting a more secure financial system.Fraud Prevention: The technical complexity involved in accurately reproducing QR codes creates a significant barrier for fraudsters attempting to duplicate PAN cards.Ratan from Signzy, Ratan, explains that the new PAN card design incorporating a QR code represents a crucial advancement in fraud prevention and regulatory adherence. The QR code technology provides enhanced security and verification capabilities by storing encrypted information about the cardholder. The sophisticated encryption makes PAN card replication virtually impossible, as the QR code verification requires authorised software, confirming the card's authenticity and proper ownership, he says.A contrasting perspective comes from Sandeep Jhunjhunwala of Nangia Andersen LLP, who notes, \"Printed PAN cards carry QR code on them, now as well. Hence, while an upgrade to a new PAN card could be done anytime, it may not necessarily mean that under PAN 2.0 project, this would always protect the taxpayer against any potential fraud. The new system is expected to include features such as mandatory Aadhaar linkage, real-time validation and advanced data analytics, all of which could potentially help in identifying and preventing frauds. However, it remains unclear now as to how effectively these features would address the potential of fraud. As PAN 2.0 evolves, stakeholders could watch out for further updates from the authorities to understand how these features would be implemented and whether additional measures would be introduced to specifically tackle the menace of financial frauds.\"115804021",

    "description1": "NEW DELHI: IndiGo has filed a trademark infringement suit against Mahindra Electric Automobile, objecting to the latter naming its upcoming EV as BE 6e as \"6E\" is the airline's flight code. Mahindra launched the electric car on Nov 26, with company officials insisting then there is no copyright infringement with use of 6e.Indigo went to the court within days. Titled Interglobe Aviation (IndiGo parent) vs Mahindra Electric Automobile, the case was on Tuesday listed to be heard in the court of Justice Amit Bansal. However, the judge recused himself from hearing the matter. The next hearing is scheduled for Dec 9. Appearing for IndiGo, senior advocate Sandeep Sethi informed the court that Mahindra had initiated discussions with the airline to address the issue.In a statement, IndiGo said: \"6E mark is an integral part of IndiGo's identity for the past 18 years and is a registered trademark that holds strong global recognition. The 6E mark, whether standalone or in its variants and formative forms, is extensively used by IndiGo for its offerings and for goods and services provided in collaboration with trusted partners.\"The airline further said, \"Any unauth",
    "description2": "orised use of the '6E' mark, whether standalone or in any form, constitutes an infringement of IndiGo's rights, reputation and goodwill. IndiGo is committed to taking all necessary and appropriate steps to safeguard its intellectual property and brand identity.\"Mahindra said it revealed EV SUVs - the BE 6e and XEV 9e - late last month. \"Mahindra has applied for trade mark registration under class 12 (vehicles) for 'BE 6e' a part of its electric origin SUV portfolio. We hence don't see a conflict as Mahindra's mark is 'BE 6e,' not the standalone '6E.' It differs fundamentally from IndiGo's '6E,' which represents an airline, eliminating any risk of confusion...\" The distinct styling further emphasises their uniqueness. We have taken on board the concerns that InterGlobe Aviation Limited have to infringement of their goodwill, which was not our intention. We are engaged in discussions with them to find an amicable solution.\"This is the second time IndiGo is locked in a legal battle with some other company using a name associated with it. In 2015, the airline had a trademark dispute with Tata Motors which then used to sell its sedan under the name IndiGo. ",

    "description1": "Elon Musk's record-setting Tesla pay package was again rejected by a Delaware judge even after shareholders supported reinstating it.Despite the June 13 shareholder vote at the company's annual meeting, Delaware Chancery court judge Kathaleen McCormick decided to stick with her original finding in Jan that the company's board was too much under the influence of the billionaire entrepreneur when it adopted the plan in 2018. The stock options package was initially worth $2.6 billion and spiked to $56 billion by the time the judge cancelled it. The package was worth $101.5 billion at Monday's closing price.McCormick's ruling striking down the highest-ever pay arrangement for a US corporate executive could take a giant bite out of Musk's wealth. Even without the payout, he remains the world's richest person. Tesla shares fell 1.4% in after-hours trading.The ruling comes just after Musk's wealth hit an all-time high - surpassing the previous record of $340.4 billion set in Nov 2021 - thanks to a Tesla stock rally following the presidential election and a new funding round for his artificial intelligence startup.Musk, 53, spent much of Oct campaigning for Donald Trump, including speaking at a Madison Square Gar",

Unlike the US Supreme Court, the state's highest court reviews all appeals of lower-court rulings. The billionaire is expected to contest McCormick's finding that Tesla directors awarded him excessive compensation because they were handcuffed by conflicts of interest Bloomberg. ",

Swiggy will build more consumption occasions and use-cases for consumers to fuel the growth of its food delivery business which had 14.7 million average monthly transacting users as of Q2. For its quick commerce business Instamart - which competes with players like Zomato's Blinkit, Zepto and BigBasket - the growth strategy will be to launch in new cities as well as deepen the footprint in existing markets.

    "description": "The RBI, on its part, has been constantly flagging the risk from continued high rate of inflation.",
    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/das.jpg",
    "description1": "Much before data released on November 29 showed that India’s economic growth had slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4 per cent in July-September, discussions within the government had questioned RBI’s upward revision of growth estimates to 7.2 per cent for 2024-25 and flagged worries about the cumulative impact of its prudential measures, The Indian Express has learnt. There were apprehensions that these had begun hurting India’s growth prospects and the RBI’s decision to keep policy rates static because of food and gold/silver inflation, has made the effective real rate of interest for the non-food part of the economy very high now, top officials said. The RBI would not agree with this assessment, said some analysts and experts tracking the central bank’s regulatory and monetary policy actions. They said housing loans are at 8.5 per cent, MSME loans are at 10-11 per cent, and if you net out inflation at 6 per cent, then the rates are not so high. A government official said, the first red flag came when RBI raised the GDP growth forecast for 2024-25 to 7.2 per cent in June from 7 per cent in April since it was out of sync with other signals. “At this point, incremental information – very hot summer, monsoon getting delayed – was negative,” the official said. This move by the RBI surprised many in the government. While there were expectations that the central bank would become more cautious, it became more confident about the growth number. On top of this, the RBI also kept its key policy rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent since February 2023, which had by the beginning of the second quarter resulted in high lending rates for non-agricultural sectors. But analysts tracking the central bank said the upward growth revision came in the backdrop of a very strong momentum from Q3 and Q4 in 2023-24. “Growth slowed in the first quarter this year because of low capex in the Centre and states, and there is a blip in Q2 mainly because of excess rains in August and September when construction activity was disrupted, and mining and electricity also slowed down,” one such analyst said. All eyes are now on RBI’s monetary review meeting December 4-6 – with Governor Shaktikanta Das’s term expected to end December 10. Government officials said the central bank’s many credit actions and macro-prudential measures such as higher risk weights on unsecured personal loans, a discussion paper on higher provisioning for project loans, and steps for digital lending were seen to be all well-intended and individually correct at the respective points of time. “But their cumulative impact was denting growth prospects,” the official said. The government thinks these measures were important, singed as it is from what it feels were the “mistakes” in the past that led to the cropping up of doubtful and bad loans. But the government couldn’t still come to terms with what it feels is RBI’s misplaced alarm over high credit-deposit ratio, which eventually has led to a sharp moderation in credit growth. The credit growth rate dropped to around 11 per cent from over 16 per cent in January this year. “Their (RBI’s) insistence on bringing down the credit-deposit ratio – if you bring down credit growth, you bring down deposit growth. You ask any banker, you give credit, and then it creates deposits. But if you crimp credit growth, you’re going to crimp deposit growth as well,” the official explained. The RBI’s financial stability report, published in June 2024, says the credit-deposit ratio meanders for 41 months before it comes back, the official pointed out. “So, it is not as if the episode of the credit-deposit ratio growing above the trend is happening for the first time. It comes down over time, with the credit growth slowing down. Collectively, they may have exerted an influence,” the official said. Analysts tracking the banking regulator attributed the prudential actions to credit exuberance – credit card outstanding was growing at 30 per cent, unsecured loans at 30 per cent, and NBFCs were diluting credit appraisal norms ",
    "description2": "and underwriting standards. Credit was being pushed irrespective of demand, and the RBI saw clear signs of a future crisis. The RBI actions in November slowed down credit growth in those segments, and this was the desired objective, they said. When a bubble bursts, then all questions are asked to the regulator, the analysts said. As the RBI maintained its guard against the high rate of inflation over the year, concerns also emerged within the government on whether the monetary policy stance is becoming too tight. It was felt the central bank was focusing a lot on food inflation, which is not completely in its control, and has been rising primarily due to price shocks in just a few items such as tomato, onion, potato among other perishables. The RBI’s action against inflation, especially as a supply-side driven issue in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, was seen as ideal but the grip does not seem to have been loosened on time as per government officials. “By reacting to food inflation, where they have no control, where there are no second-round effects, and even core inflation is more influenced by gold and silver rather than overall, it is very clear that your effective real rate of interest for the non-food part of the economy is very high now. So effectively, there is a restrictive monetary policy,” the official said. Retail inflation rate surged to a 14-month high of 6.21 per cent in October with a sharp rise in prices of food items, especially fruits, vegetables, meat and fish, and oils and fats. Food inflation shot up to a double-digit level of 10.87 per cent in October — a 15-month high — from 9.24 per cent in September, and 6.61 per cent in the year-ago period. Food and beverages account for 45.86 per cent of the total weight of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), on which retail inflation is based. Barring two months of July and August this year, the headline retail inflation rate has remained above the 4 per cent mark in the 4+/- 2 per cent band of RBI’s medium-term inflation target for 59 months. The RBI, on its part, has been constantly flagging the risk from continued high rate of inflation. In the October Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said the RBI cannot risk ‘another bout of inflation’ and so there is a need to wait for more evidence of inflation aligning durably with the 4 per cent target. If bank interest rates are low when inflation is high, it would mean a further credit exuberance, and lead to dilution of the quality of balance sheet of banks, said analysts explaining RBI action. The RBI Act, analysts pointed out, mandates price stability, and is defined in terms of headline inflation i.e., 4 per cent +/- 2 per cent. Whether it is food that causes inflation to rise, or some other constituent, at the end of the day, the mandate is to ensure it does not breach the upper end of the band, i.e., 6 per cent, they said. “In developed countries, when you have inflation targeting, you are effectively targeting labour income. Central banks react when wages start rising. In a developing country, given food is a larger component, the moment you start reacting to food, you are reacting to farmers’ terms of trade. Effectively, it is not a technocratic decision; it is a political economy decision,” the government official said. The sole focus on inflation targeting has come under question after the recent growth fallout in Q2, bringing the spotlight on the inflation versus growth debate and whether the country is facing a cyclical slowdown and is in need of anti-cyclical policy measures. “If there is a second-round effect, you must react. If it becomes generalised, you must react. My point is that the core inflation (non-food, non-fuel inflation) has suddenly gone up in the last three months from 3.2 per cent to 4.2 per cent…you take out gold and silver, core inflation is tame. So, you cannot say that food inflation is passing the second round of the passthrough effect on gold and silver. That’s a bit far-fetched,” the official said.",

    "description1": "From seeking implementation of non-price recommendations, a five-year plan for oilseeds to supply-side bottlenecks in procurement, two key financial departments, a top government think tank and a department responsible for most of the procurement in the country wrote to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, expressing concerns before the Cabinet meeting this June to clear the proposal to hike the minimum support price (MSP) of kharif crops for marketing season 2024-25, an RTI filed by The Indian Express shows. While the departments did not directly oppose the hike in the MSP, the documents show, they gave varying suggestions to look beyond the MSP to provide remunerative prices to the farmers. The Ministry of Agriculture did not agree to the suggestion on oilseeds, but it took note of the situation and proposed a maximum hike for oilseeds. The procurement of kharif crops commenced on October 1 in line with the Cabinet decision dated June 19 which increased the MSP of 14 kharif crops such as paddy, jowar, bajra, ragi, maize, tur/arhar, moong, urad, groundnut, sunflower seed, soyabean, sesamum, nigerseed and cotton. The maximum increase over the previous year was 12.70 per cent for nigerseed in oilseeds, 11.50 per cent for ragi in cereals and 7.90 per cent for tur in pulses. Look beyond MSP hike The documents accessed by The Indian Express show that the two financial departments i.e the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) &amp; Department of Expenditure (DOE) and Niti Aayog primarily focused on non-price recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), an Agriculture Ministry body which recommends MSP hike every season, and apparently opined that the government should focus on the schemes other than MSP. It also raised concerns over supply-side bottlenecks in procurement. Non-price policy recommendations aim to achieve a long-term and multi-dimensional solution to the agrarian crisis. As part of Inter-Ministerial consultation on MSP hike, DEA and DOE wrote that special schemes that are focussed on productivity enhancement, push towards atmanirbharta in pulses and oilseeds, crop diversification, micro-irrigation, empower farmers with solar power etc., which comes under non-price recommendations, are supported “in-principle”. However, these special schemes may be routed through the appraisal mechanism of Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) on financial outlays, said the departments. “While supporting the recommendations, this ministry feels that the price increase in crops should be accompanied by implementation of key non-price recommendations also … Supply- side bottlenecks such as storage, warehouse infrastructure and transportation need to be addressed in mission mode,” reads the letter of the departments dated May 16, 2024. In response before the Cabinet on this, the Ministry of Agriculture said that issues related to non-price recommendations will be dealt with separately by the department concerned. Niti Aayog also stressed on non-price recommendation and said that Shree Anna (promotion for production and consumption of nutri-cereals/millets), push towards pulses and oilseed should be given due priority and close monitoring by the department. “The price policy should be able to maintain inter-crop price parity and ensure rational utilisation of inputs and natural resources. It should enhance diversification to meet the growing food and nutritional security,” reads Niti Aayog’s letter dated May 3, 2024. In response to this, the Ministry of Agriculture said, “…to encourage crop diversification towards oilseeds and pulses, the highest absolute increase in MSP over the previous year is proposed for these crops viz. Nigerseed by Rs 983 per qtl., sesamum by Rs 632 per qtl., tur by Rs 550 per qtl., sunflower seed by Rs 420 per qtl. And that of urad by Rs 450 per qtl.” Low product",
    "description2": "ion of Oilseeds While the maximum increase in MSP was proposed for oilseeds, the Department of Food &amp; Public Distribution (DoFPD), which procures paddy, wheat and coarse grains, said that the hike has not resulted in required increase in domestic production and country needs a long-term MSP policy for oilseeds. It further said that even though an increase in production of oilseeds is estimated for 2023-24, the country will have to rely on imports to meet its requirement for edible oils. “CACP fixes the MSP on oilseeds on a seasonal basis. Although it helps in ensuring a remunerative price to the farmers, it has not delivered the required result by means of increase in domestic production. It may be helpful if a long term MSP policy, preferably for the next 5 years, is in place so that farmers know what they will get in future for their crops and may accordingly take an informed decision,” said the department in its letter dated May 24, 2024. However, the Ministry of Agriculture rejected the suggestion and said that long-term MSP policy was not viable. “While recommending MSP, CACP considers estimated cost of production, ongoing demand and supply situation and inter-crop parity in returns, terms of trade between agriculture and non-agriculture sector, rational utilization of land, water and other production resources. Therefore, long term MSP policy is not viable,” said the Agriculture Ministry in its response before the Cabinet. Oilseeds are primarily used for oil, food, feed and industrial applications. However, despite domestic production, approximately 60 per cent of India’s edible oil demand, is fulfilled through imports. Need better infra and technology Along with DOE, DEA and Niti Aayog, DoFPD also sought implementation of other Non-price recommendations and said that warehouses/storage infrastructure constructed under any government scheme/Agriculture infrastructure should mandatorily be WDRA (Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority) registered. “It will help to ensure e-NWR (Electronic Negotiable Warehouse Receipt) based pledge finance. The warehouse/storage infrastructure may be declared/notified as deemed sub-market yards under state APMC act so that the logistics cost incurred on procurement can be reduced and agri commodities can be procured at a less logistic cost,” reads the letter. Similarly, the DEA and DOE said that technology upgradation in cultivation, R&amp;D and mechanisation of farming needs to be focused upon to improve agricultural productivity. \"Improvement in marketing platforms for small and marginal farmers by promoting and strengthening FPOs (Farmer Produce Organizations), cooperatives and self-help groups (SHGs) needs priority,\" reads the letter further. In response to these, the Ministry of Agriculture said that it is implementing Agri Infra Fund (AIF) to address the existing infrastructure gaps and mobilise investment in agricultural infrastructure. It further said that the Sub-Mission in Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) is being implemented for creating high-tech farm equipment. Regarding marketing platforms, the ministry said that it is implementing the Marketing Research and Information Network, a sub-scheme of Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM), to link important agricultural produce markets spread all over the country. The Ministry has estimated to procure around 828 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of 14 agricultural produce this kharif season, out of which expected procurement of Paddy alone is 806 LMT. However, the fact is that the procurement of Rice, which recorded a continuous increase from 31.8 million tonnes in 2013-14 to 60.2 million tonnes in 2020-21, witnessed a decline during the last three seasons. The increase in MSP for paddy this season is 5.40 per cent (Rs. 117 per quintal) as the cost of production went up by 5.4 per cent over last year.",

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/11/RBI_84780d.jpg",
    "description1": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which is scheduled to meet from December 4 to 6, is likely to keep the repo rate – the key policy rate – unchanged at 6.5 per cent in the meeting. This would be the 11th consecutive monetary policy, or for 22 months, that the repo rate would have been left unchanged. The six-member MPC may also retain the monetary policy stance as ‘neutral’ in the upcoming policy, economists said. The MPC’s decision is expected to be announced on December 6. What is RBI likely to announce in the December policy? The rate-setting panel will meet against a backdrop of growing concerns over slowing economic growth and elevated inflationary pressures. These two factors will likely weigh on the MPC’s decision in its December 6 policy announcement. “Given the rather uncertain global environment and the possible impact on inflation and the fact that currently inflation has been averaging close to 5.9 per cent in the last two months, a status quo on the repo rate will be the logical outcome from the policy,” said Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda. The recent data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) showed that the country’s real gross domestic product (GDP) slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4 per cent in July-September 2024. This compares with a growth of 6.7 per cent in the April-June 2024 quarter and 8.1 per cent in the July-September 2023 period. Consumer price-based inflation (CPI), or retail inflation, surged to a 14-month high of 6.21 per cent in October 2024, compared to 5.5 per cent in September. “RBI is expected to remain on pause in December 2024, with upside risk to food inflation in the near-term. Overall headline CPI inflation in Q3FY25 is averaging closer to 6 per cent versus RBI’s estimate of 4.8 per cent. Subdued core inflation shows that inflation pressures remain localised due to presence of negative output gap,” said Gaura Sengupta, Chief Economist, IDFC FIRST Bank. Goldman Sachs also expects the RBI to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent at the December 6 policy meeting as a base case. Can there be a change in monetary policy stance? The Reserve Bank’s MPC changed the policy stance from “withdrawal of accommodation” to “neutral” in the October 2024 policy. The RBI may not tweak the stance in the forthcoming policy, analysts said. “We further expect the RBI to retain the ‘neutral’ policy stance and remain “unambiguously focused on durably aligning inflation to the target, while supporting growth”,” Goldman Sachs said in the report. In the last policy meeting, the MPC changed ",
    "description2": "the monetary policy stance to 'neutral', after keeping it as 'withdrawal of accommodation' for 28 straight months. The neutral stance indicates that conditions are now congenial for a cut in the repo rate in the near future. Growing clamour for repo rate cut Recently, two Union ministers have called for a cut in the repo rate. Last month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman batted for “affordable bank interest rates” to support industries to ramp up and build capacities. “…at a time when we want industries to ramp up and build capacities, bank interest rates will have to be far more affordable,” Sitharaman had said at an event while responding to a question on whether she expects a reduction in interest rates soon or if there could be a delay in the cut given current inflation print. Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, had also urged the RBI to cut interest rates to boost economic growth and look through food prices while deciding on monetary policy. Will RBI revise inflation and GDP projections? There could be a change in RBI projections for both inflation and GDP as inflation has been higher so far than the RBI forecast for Q3 and GDP growth is expected to be lower in Q2, said Bank of Baroda’s Sabnavis. “It would hence be of interest to see what the projections this time are,” he said. The RBI has projected real GDP growth for 2024-25 at 7.2 per cent with Q2 at 7 per cent; Q3 at 7.4 per cent; and Q4 at 7.4 per cent. The forecast for CPI is 4.5 per cent for 2024-25, with Q2 at 4.1 per cent; Q3 at 4.8 per cent; and Q4 at 4.2 per cent According to IDFC FIRST Bank’s Sengupta, there could be a downside risk to RBI’s FY25 GDP growth estimate of 7.2 per cent and upside risk to FY25 CPI inflation estimate of 4.5 per cent. So, what happens to lending rates if the repo rate is left steady? If the RBI leaves the repo rate steady at 6.5 per cent, all external benchmark lending rates (EBLR) linked to the repo rate will not increase, giving relief to borrowers as their equated monthly instalments (EMIs) will not increase. However, lenders may raise interest rates on loans that are linked to the marginal cost of fund-based lending rate (MCLR), where the full transmission of a 250 bps hike in the repo rate between May 2022 and February 2023 has not happened. In response to the 250 bps hike in the policy repo rate since May 2022, banks have revised upwards their repo-linked external benchmark-based lending rates (EBLRs) by a similar magnitude. The median 1-year marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) of SCBs has increased by 170 bps during May 2022 to October 2024.",

    "description1": "Around 16,282 pension payment orders have been issued so far by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) to members and pensioners who had applied for higher pension under the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) after the November 2022 Supreme Court ruling. Even as the retirement fund body has rejected 2.6 lakh forms for higher pension, over 6 lakh applications for validation of option and joint options from employers and employees are still under examination by the EPFO’s field offices. While the EPFO has not specified the total financial impact of the rollout of the higher pension option, it said the sample data of around 38,000 applicants for pension on higher wages shows a deficit of around Rs 9,500 crore, that is, approximately Rs 25 lakh per person. It means a member has to shell out Rs 25 lakh on an average if he/she has opted for the higher pension option based on the sample figures. “An initial estimate suggested that approximately a sum of Rs 1,86,920 crore will be depleted out of the Fund on settlement of even as less as 50 per cent of the joint option (post 2014 cases) received,” said a note shared by the EPFO on the current status of the implementation of the higher pension scheme in the 236th meeting of the EPFO’s Central Board of Trustees held Saturday. The EPFO said the actuarial analysis can be completed only after all the applications for validation of joint options are processed. A total of 17.49 lakh applications were received for the higher pension option after the Supreme Court directed the EPFO to open a window for pensioners and members to apply for it. The SC in a ruling on November 4, 2022 had upheld the amendments to the Employees’ Pension (Amendment) Scheme, 2014, providing another chance for employees who were existing EPS members as on September 1, 2014, to contribute up to 8.33 per cent of their ‘actual’ salaries — as against 8.33 per cent of the pensionable salary capped at Rs 15,000 a month — towards pension. Given the high number of pending applications for higher pension, the ",
    "description2": "EPFO is aiming for a timeline of next three months to process all the applications. To speed up the process, the EPFO is considering engaging retired officials for work. Out of the total 17.49 lakh applications received by the EPFO for higher pension, 3.12 lakh forms are pending with the employers. Thus, the net number of applications received in EPFO has been 14.37 lakh, out of which 2.7 lakh are by pensioners who retired prior to 01.09.2014, while 11.67 lakh applications are for validation of joint options by employees who were EPS members as on 01.09.2014. Demand letters have been issued to just 21 pensioners (those who retired before 01.09.2014), while 1.19 lakh demand letters have been sent to the members who were employees as on 01.09.2014. Pensioners, who retired before 01.09.2014, saw a higher rejection number with 1.91 lakh rejected forms compared with rejection of 69,767 forms of employees who were EPS members as on 01.09.2014. Pensioners also saw a lower issuance of pension payment orders with just 4 orders as against 16,278 payment orders issued to employees. In case of some exempted establishments, the EPFO said the trust rules have mentioned that the contributions to the pension fund and the provident fund would be restricted to the wage ceiling. The EPFO had kept the deadline to apply for higher pension till July 11 last year. It had then given further time of three months to employers till September 30, 2023 and then another extension till December 31, 2023, while employees had time till July 11, 2023 to submit their applications. Applications that are complete with the required information are processed and demand letters issued by the EPFO indicate the additional due amounts to the pension fund. If the applicants for higher pension under EPS have the due amount available in their provident fund accounts maintained with the EPFO, then only a diversion is required. In cases where the due amount is not available with the EPFO, then it has to be deposited by the member directly or through the employer.",

    "description1": "A redemption policy for investments in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and reinvestment of 50 per cent of those redemption proceeds into ETFs, along with an amnesty scheme for employers to voluntarily disclose and rectify past non-compliance without penalties was approved by the Central Board of Trustees of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) in its 236th meeting Saturday. The Board also discussed the pilot of the Centralised Pension Payment System (CPPS), which is likely to be launched on December 31. The EPFO, which has 7.37 crore contributing subscribers and a total of 32.56 crore members, plans to increase the ETF redemption period to 7 years from 4 years over the next six years to improve yields. While 50 per cent of the redemption proceeds will get reinvested in equity through ETFs such as Bharat 22 and CPSE ETFs, the remaining 50 per cent would be invested in other asset classes as per the existing pattern such as government securities and corporate bonds. The changes in investment norms is being done with an aim to earn better returns through investment in equity. The investment committee of the EPFO had earlier noted that “there is a need to balance the short-term returns on investments under EPF Scheme with the future growth prospects in equity”. As per the notified pattern of investment by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the EPFO can invest up to 15 per cent of its incremental flows in equity. EPFO started with an investment of 5 per cent in equity through ETFs on Sensex or Nifty in August 2015. Subsequently from 2017 the investment in ETFs was increased to 15 per cent of the fresh accretion. The 44-member CBT, headed by Labour and Employ",
    "description2": "ment Minister Mansukh Mandaviya and having both employees’ and employers’ representatives, also gave nod for the EPFO Amnesty Scheme 2024. The scheme is being brought as the Labour and Employment Ministry moves ahead with the implementation plan for the Budget announcement of Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) scheme. “The initiative is designed to encourage employers to voluntarily disclose and rectify past non-compliance or under-compliance without facing penalties or legal repercussions. A simple online declaration from employers will be sufficient to avail the scheme benefits,” the Ministry said in a statement. The amnesty scheme has been proposed in the backdrop that several small establishments, especially Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), may opt for the ELI scheme but would have faced a roadblock if there were past dues of non-compliance for EPF contribution. The CBT also approved a key feature of crediting interest at the time of claim settlements. At present, for the claim settled till 24th of the month, interest is paid only up to the end of the previous month. Now, the interest will be paid to the member up to the date of settlement. The Board also discussed the earlier decision to increase the limit for auto claims settlement facility to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 50,000 which is now applicable for advances for housing, marriage and education. In the current financial year 2024-25, the EPFO has settled 1.15 crore claims in auto mode. “During the Financial Year 2023-24, the EPFO settled 4.45 crore claims for an amount of Rs 1.82 lakh crore. In the current FY, 3.83 crore claims have already been settled for more than Rs.1.57 lakh crore,” the Ministry said.",

    "description1": "Setting the stage to counter any challenge to the dollar’s domination in global trade, US President-elect Donald Trump has threatened the BRICS grouping, which has India, Russia and China among its key members, with “100 per cent tariffs” if it moved to create a new currency or back any other option as the world’s reserve. “The idea that the BRICS countries are trying to move away from the dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER,” Trump wrote in a social media post early Sunday. “We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency nor back any other currency to replace the mighty U.S. dollar, or they will face 100 per cent tariffs and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. economy. They can go find another ‘sucker!’ There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the US dollar in international trade, and any country that tries should wave goodbye to America,” Trump posted. With the USD accounting for over 90 per cent of global transactions, Trump's latest remarks come amid divergent views on the issue at the BRICS summit in October. At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin had warned that the “dollar is being used as a weapon”. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi had cautioned that the grouping should not acquire the image of one that is trying to replace global institutions. Trump’s threat also comes at a time when US sanctions on Russia have resulted in Russian oil being redirected from Europe to Asia. However, international trade experts warn that any such tariff move by the US would “ultimately hurt America the most”. According to them, several countries have been looking at other “mechanisms” after the US “weaponised the global financial infrastructure” by throwing Iran and Russia out of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), which is the key to international transactions. “It is the actions of the United States that have pushed many countries to seek alternatives to the US dollar. The US has a history of leveraging its influence over global financial systems, such as the SWIFT network, to impose unilateral sanctions. By blocking countries like Russia and Iran from accessing SWIFT, the US has effectively weaponised the global financial infrastructure, forcing other nations to find alternative payment mechanisms to continue legitimate trade,” former trade officer and head of the think tank, Global Trade Research Initiative, Ajay Srivastava, said. Srivastava also said that imposing a 100 per cent tariff on BRICS countries could backfire economically. “Imports into the US would simply shift to third countries, potentially increasing costs for American consumers without bringing manufacturing jobs back home. The US has become less competitive in manufacturing labour-intensive goods due to higher production costs, and tariffs are unlikely to reverse this trend,” he said. BRICS stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the original five members. This year, the group admitted four new members - Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and UAE - and now represents almost half the world’s population and almost one quarter of its economy. Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) Director General &amp; CEO Ajay Sahai said that India should engage diplomatically with the US to explain its position, emphasising that diversifying trade mechanisms is not anti-American but a move towards multipolarity and financial stability. “We should accelerate the development and internationalisation of digital currency (CBDC) and financial platforms like UPI to take a leadership role in BRICS currency initiatives. Trump’s threat might am",
    "description2": "plify geopolitical tensions, but it is unlikely to deter BRICS nations from pursuing alternatives to the US dollar. For India, the best course is a balanced approach: supporting financial reforms within BRICS that align with its interests while maintaining strong ties with the US to safeguard its broader strategic and economic priorities,” Sahai said. Meanwhile, the IMF’s Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) has pointed to a gradual decline in the dollar’s share of central bank and government foreign reserves. But the reduced role of the US dollar over the past two decades has not been matched by corresponding increases in the shares of the other “big four” currencies, the euro, yen and pound, according to the IMF. “Rather, this has been accompanied by a rise in the share of what we refer to as non-traditional reserve currencies, including the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, South Korean won, Singaporean dollar, and the Nordic currencies,” the IMF said in July. Significantly, the IMF also said that one non-traditional reserve currency gaining market share is the Chinese renminbi, whose gains match a quarter of the decline in the dollar’s share. “The Chinese government has been advancing policies on multiple fronts to promote renminbi internationalization, including the development of a cross-border payment system, the extension of swap lines, and piloting a central bank digital currency. It is thus interesting to note that renminbi internationalization, at least as measured by the currency’s reserve share, shows signs of stalling out,” IMF said about the key BRICS member. “China is very keen to assume a dominant role to use the (BRICS) bloc against the US, though India, Brazil and South Africa are more keen to work with the US and settle the differences amicably through negotiations,” FIEO chief Sahai said. In India, an effort to reduce reliance on the US dollar and internationalise the rupee saw the RBI allowing invoicing and payments for global trade in rupees in 2022 after sanctions were imposed on Russia amid the Ukraine war. According to the BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey 2022, foreign exchange market turnover - daily averages - shows that the US dollar accounted for 88 per cent of the global forex turnover while the rupee accounted for 1.6 per cent. The survey stated that if rupee turnover rises to equal the share of non-US, non-Euro currencies in global forex turnover of 4 per cent, it will be regarded as an international currency. But India’s trade with Russia in domestic currency remains low due to Indian banks' fear of US sanctions and an unbalanced trade relationship between the two countries. While there has been a multifold rise in India-Russia trade after the Ukraine war, it has been firmly in favour of Russia. According to official data, India’s exports to Russia stood at $4.2 billion in FY24, but increasing oil imports from Moscow have widened the import bill to $61 billion. As a result, Russia has a huge pile of rupee reserves that it has not been able to use to settle bilateral trade using domestic currency and is instead using it to invest in Indian stocks and bonds. In October, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said that while India is pursuing its trade interests, avoiding the use of the US dollar is not part of economic policy. Jaishankar said US policies often complicate trade with certain countries, and India is seeking “workarounds” without intending to move away from using the dollar, unlike some other nations. However, the Union Minister did add that a multipolar world will eventually be reflected in “currencies and economic dealings”.",

    "description1": "After growing at a robust 52 per cent annually since the Covid-19 pandemic, residential launches across India’s top real estate markets fell by 2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This marks the sector’s first slowdown since the post-2020 boom, with just one ticket size bucking the trend – luxury units priced above Rs 2.5 crore. The growing premiumisation of India’s residential real estate sector amidst easing demand is also evident in sales, which fell by 3 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) between April and September 2024, while the average ticket size of units sold grew by 23 per cent, an analysis of data from Anarock showed. In the Delhi-NCR market, where demand for luxury housing is especially pronounced, sales fell by 0.6 per cent while the average price of units sold surged by 56 per cent. The first signs of a slowdown in residential real estate mirror recent concerns around waning urban demand across sectors, from automobiles to consumer goods. Major developers have announced plans to transition away from affordable housing as they no longer see a business opportunity in the segment. Even in the upper-end Rs 1.5-2.5 crore segment, launches fell by 15 per cent y-o-y in the first three quarters of 2024, as against doubling each year between 2020 and 2023. Strong demand for luxury housing Launches of residential units priced above Rs 2.5 crore across the top seven cities—including the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, and Chennai—surged at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 116 per cent between 2020 and 2023, marking an unprecedented boom in luxury housing. From just 4,000 such units in 2020, launches soared to over 41,000 in 2023. Even in the first three quarters of 2024, when overall residential launches declined by 2 per cent, luxury launches displayed notable resilience, growing by 56 per cent to over 52,000 units. After the pandemic, housing became increasingly aspirational for urban Indians, with mid-segment buyers gravitating toward projects offering superior amenities and better connectivity. Demand for larger homes with flexible configurations, such as additional rooms, has also risen sharply. Reflecting this trend, the average flat size grew from 1,167 square feet in 2020 to 1,300 square feet in 2023—a rise of 11.4 per cent, according to data from Anarock. In an earnings call last month, Aakash Ohri, Joint MD at DLF Ltd, noted that demand for luxury housing is no longer confined by a north-south geographic divide. “I have seen in super luxury, including our projects in Goa and of course, Camellias, it has been pan-India. The recent sales and the interest that I'm seeing is coming from top families of Tier 2 cities all over the country… I feel that the start point is where we are today. It is only going to go up,” Ohri said. Others are more cautious–Jagadish Nangineni, MD of Bangalore-headquartered Sobha Ltd, believes that luxury sales may begin to s",
    "description2": "tabilise. “I think there is a steadiness in the market and probably what we can anticipate is not (what) we have seen (with) the increase in the sales volumes in the last couple of years. Probably we are reaching a steady state instead of continuous increase in terms of demand,” Nangineni told analysts on November 15. Developers pivot from affordable housing Between 2020 and 2023, launches below Rs 40 lakh grew at the slowest CAGR of 29 per cent to a little over 83,000 units. The next ticket size – launches priced between Rs 40 lakh and Rs 1.5 crore – grew at 50 per cent to around 2,60,000 units. Growth in both these ticket sizes was lower than the overall CAGR of 52 per cent. In the first three quarters of 2024, launches below Rs 40 lakh fell by 10 per cent and those between Rs 40 lakh and Rs 1.5 crore fell by 7 per cent. The latest data reflects what developers have been saying for some time – both demand and margins are higher in the premium segments. Soaring input costs and land prices have also made affordable projects in and around metropolitan cities harder to execute. Abhishek Lodha, MD and CEO of Macrotech Developers Ltd, reiterated the company’s “planned transition” away from entry-level housing towards the “upper end of the mid-income and beyond” in a recent earnings call. “As a consequence of that… we will be moving from a tilt of about 85% to 90% of our sales coming from lower mid-income and entry-level housing to that moving to 50%, obviously, over a period of 3 years,” Lodha said. Amit Kumar Sinha, MD and CEO of Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd, also confirmed that the company “will not pursue affordable anymore”. “So, that segment is out. And while super luxury and all are very exciting, our focus is going to mid-premium and premium. And the way we segment the market is affordable, mid-premium, premium and luxury… we will play in the middle 2 segments, we will not play in the 2 extreme segments,” Sinha told analysts last month. Pavitra Shankar, MD of Brigade Enterprises Ltd said on November 14 – “If in future, there was affordable housing, we would look at that, too, if there was opportunity there. But currently, there is a lot of demand in terms of premiumization of consumer demand itself, whether real estate or any sector. So that's why we are capitalizing on this trend.” Among top 7 cities, Delhi-NCR recorded the steepest rise in the average price of units sold, which surged to Rs 1.45 crore between April to September 2024 from Rs 0.93 crore during the same period in 2023. On the other hand, sales fell slightly by 0.6 per cent to 32,125 units. In Bangalore, the average price of units sold jumped by 44 per cent to Rs 1.21 crore while sales fell 0.2 per cent to 31,380 units. The MMR region was the only exception among major cities to record a positive growth in units sold – from 76,410 to 77,735 units, a growth of 1.7 per cent. The average price of units sold in and around Mumbai also did not change from Rs 1.47 crore.",

    "description": "Indicating the rising indebtedness, credit card outstanding rose to Rs 2.71 lakh crore by September 2024 from Rs 2.30 lakh crore in September last year.",
    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/11/RBI_84780d.jpg",
    "description1": "Early signs of stress in India's microfinance institutions, small finance lenders, and unsecured personal loans are beginning to show up, primarily driven by escalating borrower indebtedness. Latest data reveals a surge in delinquencies during the first half of FY25, with multiple analysts predicting this trend to persist into the next half year, casting a shadow over the asset quality of underlying loans. As a result, small and micro loans face significant risks to their growth and profitability, sparking concerns about the sector's resilience in these challenging times, analysts and rating agencies said. On November 13, ESAF Small Finance Bank, which used to focus on micro loans, reported a jump in gross non-performing assets (NPAs) to Rs 1,279.3 crore (6.9 per cent of advances) for the quarter ended September 2024 from Rs 399.1 crore (2.6 per cent) a year ago due to its concentration on micro loans. Its share price has plummeted from a 52-week high of Rs 82.26 to Rs 39.01 now. Aviom India Housing Finance informed its lenders earlier this month about an ongoing audit by the National Housing Bank (NHB) in the wake of the discovery of fraudulent transactions during a recent onsite supervisory inspection. Saying that there could be a delay in repayments to creditors, Aviom said in a letter to lenders that, “the NHB audit was initiated following the regular on-site supervisory inspection that resulted in observations, including that the statement of accounts of mutual fund(s) appear to be managed.” CRISIL has estimated that the gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of small finance banks (SFBs) are expected to move up to 2.9 per cent by the end of fiscal 2025 from 2.3 per cent as on March 31, 2024. “As a result, credit cost is set to rise 40 bps (basis points) to 1.4 per cent. The impact of the expected delinquency trends will not be uniform, though. The extent of rise in gross NPAs and credit costs across SFBs will vary based on the extent of their exposure to the vulnerable segments,” said Vani Ojasvi, associate director, CRISIL Ratings. Indicating the rising indebtedness, credit card outstanding rose to Rs 2.71 lakh crore by September 2024 from Rs 2.30 lakh crore in September last year. The Reserve Bank of India stepped in to check the rampant rise in the indebtedness and delinquencies in the personal loan segment with more restrictions last year, leading to a decline in the growth in the overall personal loan book of banks to 5 per cent as of September this year from 18 per cent a year ago. ICRA said delinquencies in the microfinance institutions (MFI) sector rose to 2.4 per cent by June 2024 from 2.1 per cent in March, while highlighting the increasing delinquencies in the microfinance sector, which is likely to push up the NBFC-MFI credit costs to 320-340 bps — one basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point — in FY25 from 220 bps in FY24. The evolving asset quality risks will dampen sectoral growth and earnings in the current fiscal. ICRA expects NBFC-MFIs’ assets under management (AUM) growth to dip to 17-19 per cent in FY25 from 29 per cent in FY24. Microfinance institutions faced a significant rise in delinquencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, according to Crisil. Early-stage delinquencies (0+ and 30+ days past due) increased by 110 basis points and 55 basis points, respectively, compared to the preceding March quarter. Four key factors contributed to this decline in portfolio quality: lending to over-leveraged borrowers, debt-waiver campaigns, high field-staff attrition, and operational challenges due to elections and extreme weather. As a result, average monthly collection efficiency dropped to 96 per cent in Q1 FY25 and further to 94 per cent in Q2, down from 98 per cent in the previous fiscal, CRISIL said. According to Jyoti Prakash Gadia, managing director, Resurgent India, while the banking industry as a whole is showing resilience with a gradually reduced NPA, stress is visible in microfinance, small finance, and unsecured loans. “This is primarily because of the relatively more aggressive approach adopted by these institutions in granting loans. The risk assessment and compliance criteria have been apparently diluted with the element of flexibility in selecting the borrowers,” Gadia said. Target hunting with an intent to expand quickly has prompted sanctions on some borrowers who did not have adequate cash flows to fall back upon for repayment, leading to stress. The overall economic scenario at the rural and semi-urban level has also not improved to a level of buoyancy, thereby creating stress for small loans, Gadia said. In fiscal 2025, microfinance loans and unsecured personal loans, where early signs of stress are visible on account of a rise in borrower indebtedness, will see a moderation in portfolio quality. Sub-segments within secured asset classes, catering in part to a similar customer segment, could also see higher delinquencies, CRISIL said. The RBI has recently imposed a ‘cease and desist order’ on some NBFC-MFIs, preventing them from sanctioning and disbursing loans. “The re",
    "description2": "strictions were due to issues related to predatory pricing, insufficient transparency in disclosures, and improper evaluation of household income and fixed monthly liabilities. Additionally, concerns have been raised about lending to customers with multiple fake voter IDs, often categorised as new-to-credit (NTC) customers, which further undermines the integrity of the lending process,” CareEdge Ratings said in a report. In October, the RBI cautioned non-banking finance companies against aggressively pursuing growth without building up sustainable business practices and risk management frameworks, commensurate with the scale and complexity of their portfolio. “The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring these areas and will not hesitate to take appropriate action, if necessary,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said. Driven by the significant accretion to their capital from both domestic and overseas sources, and sometimes under pressure from their investors, some NBFCs — including microfinance institutions (MFIs) and housing finance companies (HFCs) — are “chasing excessive returns on their equity”, he said. Furthermore, the RBI has raised concerns regarding the practice of loan netting by MFIs and has instructed certain banks and MFIs to ensure that this does not lead to ‘ever-greening of delinquent loans’. The increasing borrower indebtedness is compounded by various factors, such as heatwaves, general elections, and political movements like the “Karja Mukti Abhiyan (loan waiver scheme).” This challenge is further aggravated by the weakening of the joint liability group model, characterised by a notable decrease in centre attendance and diminished peer pressure and collective accountability, which have historically helped maintain low default rates, CareEdge said. The profitability of small finance banks, measured in terms of return on assets (RoA), will moderate around 40 bps to 1.7 per cent this fiscal from 2.1 per cent for FY24 due to lower net interest margins (NIM) and higher credit costs, CRISIL said. The overall profitability will continue to be significantly influenced by credit costs. Small finance banks are bracing for a potential surge in delinquencies and credit costs, driven by economic stress, and rising borrower indebtedness. SFBs, catering to relatively vulnerable customers, tend to experience higher delinquencies during economic downturns, as witnessed during the pandemic. \"Early signs of stress are visible in microfinance and unsecured personal loans due to increasing borrower indebtedness,\" CRISIL noted. \"SFBs must proactively manage risk and tighten lending norms to mitigate potential losses,\" it said. “The challenge is higher for unsecured asset classes such as personal loans, business loans, and MFIs. The impact on the MFI segment is higher,” said Sanjay Aggarwal, senior director, CARE Ratings. He expects credit cost for NBFC-MFIs to be at 7 per cent in FY2025, compared to 2.5 per cent in FY24. Analysts see a significant slowdown in the loan book of NBFCs due to the higher base effect, the reduction in bank funding to NBFCs and the tightening of underwriting standards by non-bank lenders. “Overall, there will be a slowdown in the loan growth of NBFCs as bank funding to these entities has reduced. The lower funding is because the RBI wants growth in retail loans to come down as certain borrowers are overleveraged, which increases the risk of higher defaults,” said a banking analyst. CAUTIOUS APPROACH NEEDED The expectations of significant improvements in future earnings and social aspirations have led to a substantial increase in unsecured borrowings by new consumers, and this portfolio, particularly of NBFCs and microfinance institutions, has grown faster. The delinquencies have correspondingly grown in the absence of adequate generation of income and surplus impacting the repayment capacity, Gadia said. Experts said it’s a matter of concern and a careful approach with brakes on fresh sanctions in these segments is needed. In addition, stronger recovery efforts are also called for to bring in control of the overall position. The regulator has taken suitable steps in this direction to maintain the desired balance and order in the portfolio. The small loan industry faces significant challenges beyond financial and operational risks, including high staff turnover and rising fraud, both of which disrupt client relationships and loan recovery. These issues, coupled with vulnerabilities to socio-political risks and natural disasters, further complicate the already difficult operating environment for NBFC-MFIs, making 2025 a challenging year ahead. However, despite operating in a vulnerable segment, the NBFC-MFI sector has consistently shown resilience, overcoming challenges like Covid-19 and demonetisation. Its ability to recover and adapt has earned continued investor support, highlighting the sector's strength and its critical role in financial inclusion. CareEdge Ratings expect that the sector will also navigate through the current stress and continue playing a vital role in serving underserved communities.",

    "description1": "PAN 2.0: The Modi government has approved a new PAN 2.0 project and the first question that comes to the mind of taxpayers is, should they apply for the upgraded PAN Card under PAN 2.0? A free application option for a new PAN will be available for those needing to correct or update their details, such as name or date of birth. It’s important to note that the Income Tax Department has issued a statement confirming that current PAN cardholders need not mandatorily obtain a new PAN under the PAN 2.0 initiative. Should you replace old PAN with new PAN Card under PAN 2.0?Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code. Experts believe that the updated PAN card design with PAN 2.0 will reduce fraud risks through its integrated QR code whilst enabling quick verification.What are the benefits of PAN Card with QR Code?Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services - Financial Services told ET, \"Upgrading to the new PAN card design with a QR code is a proactive step for users to safeguard their identity and financial information. It helps reduce the likelihood of falling prey to fraudulent activities.\"Supporting this perspective, Ankit Ratan, CEO & Co-founder, Signzy - an online identity verification and customer onboarding company told ET, \"Under the PAN 2.0 initiative, the entire process of PAN application has been digitized. This enables provision of seamless PAN authentication and validation services to various organisations, including financial institutions, banks, and governmental bodies at both central and state levels.\"Also Read | PAN 2.0 FAQs answered! Will your PAN Card change, will it have a new number? Income Tax Department releases top 10 pointsAccording to Babbar, the QR code integration with PAN Card offers several advantages to taxpayers:Strengthened Security Features: The incorporation of QR code technology in the new PAN card significantly reduces vulnerability to duplication or alteration. The encrypted personal information within the QR code is accessible solely to authorised personnel with specific software. This security measure prevents fraudsters from modifying names and photographs whilst retaining the original PAN number. Financial institutions ",
    "description2": "can utilise the QR code to authenticate the printed information.Efficient Authentication Process: Identity verification becomes streamlined through the QR code scanning feature on the updated PAN card. The immediate verification process serves as protection against identity theft and impersonation. This functionality proves particularly valuable during financial transactions by reducing errors and fraudulent activities.Current Information Maintenance: The upgraded PAN card ensures user details conform to the Income Tax Department's latest formatting requirements.Regulatory Adherence: Users who obtain the redesigned PAN card align with the government's updated identification protocols, supporting a more secure financial system.Fraud Prevention: The technical complexity involved in accurately reproducing QR codes creates a significant barrier for fraudsters attempting to duplicate PAN cards.Ratan from Signzy, Ratan, explains that the new PAN card design incorporating a QR code represents a crucial advancement in fraud prevention and regulatory adherence. The QR code technology provides enhanced security and verification capabilities by storing encrypted information about the cardholder. The sophisticated encryption makes PAN card replication virtually impossible, as the QR code verification requires authorised software, confirming the card's authenticity and proper ownership, he says.A contrasting perspective comes from Sandeep Jhunjhunwala of Nangia Andersen LLP, who notes, \"Printed PAN cards carry QR code on them, now as well. Hence, while an upgrade to a new PAN card could be done anytime, it may not necessarily mean that under PAN 2.0 project, this would always protect the taxpayer against any potential fraud. The new system is expected to include features such as mandatory Aadhaar linkage, real-time validation and advanced data analytics, all of which could potentially help in identifying and preventing frauds. However, it remains unclear now as to how effectively these features would address the potential of fraud. As PAN 2.0 evolves, stakeholders could watch out for further updates from the authorities to understand how these features would be implemented and whether additional measures would be introduced to specifically tackle the menace of financial frauds.\"115804021",

    "description1": "Indian bonds are set for the best year in four and investors expect more gains on a combination of policy drivers and resilient domestic demand.The central bank’s rate cuts anticipated from early next year on slowing economic growth, continued index-inclusion-related foreign inflows and strong demand from local pension and insurance companies are likely to further burnish the appeal of sovereign notes.Quantum Asset Management forecasts the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond to fall as much as 50 basis points by mid-2025, while Trust Mutual Fund sees the rate sliding toward 6.25%-6.5% over the next year and a half.While a resurgent dollar and higher Treasury yields have dented the appeal of emerging-market assets in recent weeks on concerns about US President-elect Donald Trump’s policies, Indian bonds have remained largely insulated.Even as “there are headwinds from a stronger dollar and higher US Treasury yields, the ongoing bond index inclusion flows are likely to provide sustained solid passive support to Indian bonds,” Barclays Plc strategists including Mitul Kotecha wrote in a note.Indian Bonds Set for Best Year in FourThe yield on the 10-year bond fell by nine basis points on Friday to close at 6.74%, a few basis points lower than early November when the US election results were announced.Bonds rallied on Friday after data showed Ind",

Yields rose to 6.87% on Nov. 22, the highest in more than two months, as some global investors chose to cash in until further clarity on Trump’s policy. The rush of inflows driven by the nation’s inclusion in JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s flagship index is also taking a breather.Notwithstanding the short-term swings, 10-year yields are down more than 40 basis points this year, the most since 2020. That happened as local bonds received about $15 billion of foreign inflows during the period, aided by the JPMorgan gauge addition.India’s index-eligible bonds are also due to find a place in other global indexes, including those of FTSE Russell from next year, potentially attracting more foreign inflows.While the Reserve Bank of India is likely to keep its policy rate unchanged on Dec. 6, traders will watch for cues on when it will start cutting rates. The RBI changed its policy stance to neutral in its most recent rate decision in October.Swaps are pricing in 50 basis points of rate cuts by June 2025, said Pankaj Pathak, a fixed-income fund manager at Quantum Asset. Bonds are likely to gain on the easing and higher foreign inflows, he said.",

    "description2": ". This growth is driven by expectations of strong kharif cultivation, owing to a healthy monsoon season that ended 8 percent above the Long Period Average.“All this should provide a fillip to agricultural incomes and rural consumption,” Crisil stated.Additionally, the abundant supply of kharif crops in the market is expected to help reduce food prices, which have been high in recent months, affecting the purchasing power of both rural and urban households. October’s food inflation was primarily driven by rising vegetable, oil, and fruit prices.“Easing inflation, along with the onset of the festive and wedding season, is likely to buoy consumption growth in the second half of this fiscal year,” the report added.India’s retail inflation in October stood at 6.21 percent, breaching the RBI’s upper limit of 6 percent.Food prices remain a major concern for policymakers in India, who aim to bring retail inflation down to a sustainable 4 percent. To keep inflation under control, the RBI has maintained the repo rate at 6.5 percent.",
