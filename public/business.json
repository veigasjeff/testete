    "description": "The RBI, on its part, has been constantly flagging the risk from continued high rate of inflation.",
    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/das.jpg",
    "description1": "Much before data released on November 29 showed that India’s economic growth had slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4 per cent in July-September, discussions within the government had questioned RBI’s upward revision of growth estimates to 7.2 per cent for 2024-25 and flagged worries about the cumulative impact of its prudential measures, The Indian Express has learnt. There were apprehensions that these had begun hurting India’s growth prospects and the RBI’s decision to keep policy rates static because of food and gold/silver inflation, has made the effective real rate of interest for the non-food part of the economy very high now, top officials said. The RBI would not agree with this assessment, said some analysts and experts tracking the central bank’s regulatory and monetary policy actions. They said housing loans are at 8.5 per cent, MSME loans are at 10-11 per cent, and if you net out inflation at 6 per cent, then the rates are not so high. A government official said, the first red flag came when RBI raised the GDP growth forecast for 2024-25 to 7.2 per cent in June from 7 per cent in April since it was out of sync with other signals. “At this point, incremental information – very hot summer, monsoon getting delayed – was negative,” the official said. This move by the RBI surprised many in the government. While there were expectations that the central bank would become more cautious, it became more confident about the growth number. On top of this, the RBI also kept its key policy rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent since February 2023, which had by the beginning of the second quarter resulted in high lending rates for non-agricultural sectors. But analysts tracking the central bank said the upward growth revision came in the backdrop of a very strong momentum from Q3 and Q4 in 2023-24. “Growth slowed in the first quarter this year because of low capex in the Centre and states, and there is a blip in Q2 mainly because of excess rains in August and September when construction activity was disrupted, and mining and electricity also slowed down,” one such analyst said. All eyes are now on RBI’s monetary review meeting December 4-6 – with Governor Shaktikanta Das’s term expected to end December 10. Government officials said the central bank’s many credit actions and macro-prudential measures such as higher risk weights on unsecured personal loans, a discussion paper on higher provisioning for project loans, and steps for digital lending were seen to be all well-intended and individually correct at the respective points of time. “But their cumulative impact was denting growth prospects,” the official said. The government thinks these measures were important, singed as it is from what it feels were the “mistakes” in the past that led to the cropping up of doubtful and bad loans. But the government couldn’t still come to terms with what it feels is RBI’s misplaced alarm over high credit-deposit ratio, which eventually has led to a sharp moderation in credit growth. The credit growth rate dropped to around 11 per cent from over 16 per cent in January this year. “Their (RBI’s) insistence on bringing down the credit-deposit ratio – if you bring down credit growth, you bring down deposit growth. You ask any banker, you give credit, and then it creates deposits. But if you crimp credit growth, you’re going to crimp deposit growth as well,” the official explained. The RBI’s financial stability report, published in June 2024, says the credit-deposit ratio meanders for 41 months before it comes back, the official pointed out. “So, it is not as if the episode of the credit-deposit ratio growing above the trend is happening for the first time. It comes down over time, with the credit growth slowing down. Collectively, they may have exerted an influence,” the official said. Analysts tracking the banking regulator attributed the prudential actions to credit exuberance – credit card outstanding was growing at 30 per cent, unsecured loans at 30 per cent, and NBFCs were diluting credit appraisal norms ",
    "description2": "and underwriting standards. Credit was being pushed irrespective of demand, and the RBI saw clear signs of a future crisis. The RBI actions in November slowed down credit growth in those segments, and this was the desired objective, they said. When a bubble bursts, then all questions are asked to the regulator, the analysts said. As the RBI maintained its guard against the high rate of inflation over the year, concerns also emerged within the government on whether the monetary policy stance is becoming too tight. It was felt the central bank was focusing a lot on food inflation, which is not completely in its control, and has been rising primarily due to price shocks in just a few items such as tomato, onion, potato among other perishables. The RBI’s action against inflation, especially as a supply-side driven issue in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, was seen as ideal but the grip does not seem to have been loosened on time as per government officials. “By reacting to food inflation, where they have no control, where there are no second-round effects, and even core inflation is more influenced by gold and silver rather than overall, it is very clear that your effective real rate of interest for the non-food part of the economy is very high now. So effectively, there is a restrictive monetary policy,” the official said. Retail inflation rate surged to a 14-month high of 6.21 per cent in October with a sharp rise in prices of food items, especially fruits, vegetables, meat and fish, and oils and fats. Food inflation shot up to a double-digit level of 10.87 per cent in October — a 15-month high — from 9.24 per cent in September, and 6.61 per cent in the year-ago period. Food and beverages account for 45.86 per cent of the total weight of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), on which retail inflation is based. Barring two months of July and August this year, the headline retail inflation rate has remained above the 4 per cent mark in the 4+/- 2 per cent band of RBI’s medium-term inflation target for 59 months. The RBI, on its part, has been constantly flagging the risk from continued high rate of inflation. In the October Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said the RBI cannot risk ‘another bout of inflation’ and so there is a need to wait for more evidence of inflation aligning durably with the 4 per cent target. If bank interest rates are low when inflation is high, it would mean a further credit exuberance, and lead to dilution of the quality of balance sheet of banks, said analysts explaining RBI action. The RBI Act, analysts pointed out, mandates price stability, and is defined in terms of headline inflation i.e., 4 per cent +/- 2 per cent. Whether it is food that causes inflation to rise, or some other constituent, at the end of the day, the mandate is to ensure it does not breach the upper end of the band, i.e., 6 per cent, they said. “In developed countries, when you have inflation targeting, you are effectively targeting labour income. Central banks react when wages start rising. In a developing country, given food is a larger component, the moment you start reacting to food, you are reacting to farmers’ terms of trade. Effectively, it is not a technocratic decision; it is a political economy decision,” the government official said. The sole focus on inflation targeting has come under question after the recent growth fallout in Q2, bringing the spotlight on the inflation versus growth debate and whether the country is facing a cyclical slowdown and is in need of anti-cyclical policy measures. “If there is a second-round effect, you must react. If it becomes generalised, you must react. My point is that the core inflation (non-food, non-fuel inflation) has suddenly gone up in the last three months from 3.2 per cent to 4.2 per cent…you take out gold and silver, core inflation is tame. So, you cannot say that food inflation is passing the second round of the passthrough effect on gold and silver. That’s a bit far-fetched,” the official said.",

    "description1": "From seeking implementation of non-price recommendations, a five-year plan for oilseeds to supply-side bottlenecks in procurement, two key financial departments, a top government think tank and a department responsible for most of the procurement in the country wrote to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, expressing concerns before the Cabinet meeting this June to clear the proposal to hike the minimum support price (MSP) of kharif crops for marketing season 2024-25, an RTI filed by The Indian Express shows. While the departments did not directly oppose the hike in the MSP, the documents show, they gave varying suggestions to look beyond the MSP to provide remunerative prices to the farmers. The Ministry of Agriculture did not agree to the suggestion on oilseeds, but it took note of the situation and proposed a maximum hike for oilseeds. The procurement of kharif crops commenced on October 1 in line with the Cabinet decision dated June 19 which increased the MSP of 14 kharif crops such as paddy, jowar, bajra, ragi, maize, tur/arhar, moong, urad, groundnut, sunflower seed, soyabean, sesamum, nigerseed and cotton. The maximum increase over the previous year was 12.70 per cent for nigerseed in oilseeds, 11.50 per cent for ragi in cereals and 7.90 per cent for tur in pulses. Look beyond MSP hike The documents accessed by The Indian Express show that the two financial departments i.e the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) &amp; Department of Expenditure (DOE) and Niti Aayog primarily focused on non-price recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), an Agriculture Ministry body which recommends MSP hike every season, and apparently opined that the government should focus on the schemes other than MSP. It also raised concerns over supply-side bottlenecks in procurement. Non-price policy recommendations aim to achieve a long-term and multi-dimensional solution to the agrarian crisis. As part of Inter-Ministerial consultation on MSP hike, DEA and DOE wrote that special schemes that are focussed on productivity enhancement, push towards atmanirbharta in pulses and oilseeds, crop diversification, micro-irrigation, empower farmers with solar power etc., which comes under non-price recommendations, are supported “in-principle”. However, these special schemes may be routed through the appraisal mechanism of Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) on financial outlays, said the departments. “While supporting the recommendations, this ministry feels that the price increase in crops should be accompanied by implementation of key non-price recommendations also … Supply- side bottlenecks such as storage, warehouse infrastructure and transportation need to be addressed in mission mode,” reads the letter of the departments dated May 16, 2024. In response before the Cabinet on this, the Ministry of Agriculture said that issues related to non-price recommendations will be dealt with separately by the department concerned. Niti Aayog also stressed on non-price recommendation and said that Shree Anna (promotion for production and consumption of nutri-cereals/millets), push towards pulses and oilseed should be given due priority and close monitoring by the department. “The price policy should be able to maintain inter-crop price parity and ensure rational utilisation of inputs and natural resources. It should enhance diversification to meet the growing food and nutritional security,” reads Niti Aayog’s letter dated May 3, 2024. In response to this, the Ministry of Agriculture said, “…to encourage crop diversification towards oilseeds and pulses, the highest absolute increase in MSP over the previous year is proposed for these crops viz. Nigerseed by Rs 983 per qtl., sesamum by Rs 632 per qtl., tur by Rs 550 per qtl., sunflower seed by Rs 420 per qtl. And that of urad by Rs 450 per qtl.” Low product",
    "description2": "ion of Oilseeds While the maximum increase in MSP was proposed for oilseeds, the Department of Food &amp; Public Distribution (DoFPD), which procures paddy, wheat and coarse grains, said that the hike has not resulted in required increase in domestic production and country needs a long-term MSP policy for oilseeds. It further said that even though an increase in production of oilseeds is estimated for 2023-24, the country will have to rely on imports to meet its requirement for edible oils. “CACP fixes the MSP on oilseeds on a seasonal basis. Although it helps in ensuring a remunerative price to the farmers, it has not delivered the required result by means of increase in domestic production. It may be helpful if a long term MSP policy, preferably for the next 5 years, is in place so that farmers know what they will get in future for their crops and may accordingly take an informed decision,” said the department in its letter dated May 24, 2024. However, the Ministry of Agriculture rejected the suggestion and said that long-term MSP policy was not viable. “While recommending MSP, CACP considers estimated cost of production, ongoing demand and supply situation and inter-crop parity in returns, terms of trade between agriculture and non-agriculture sector, rational utilization of land, water and other production resources. Therefore, long term MSP policy is not viable,” said the Agriculture Ministry in its response before the Cabinet. Oilseeds are primarily used for oil, food, feed and industrial applications. However, despite domestic production, approximately 60 per cent of India’s edible oil demand, is fulfilled through imports. Need better infra and technology Along with DOE, DEA and Niti Aayog, DoFPD also sought implementation of other Non-price recommendations and said that warehouses/storage infrastructure constructed under any government scheme/Agriculture infrastructure should mandatorily be WDRA (Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority) registered. “It will help to ensure e-NWR (Electronic Negotiable Warehouse Receipt) based pledge finance. The warehouse/storage infrastructure may be declared/notified as deemed sub-market yards under state APMC act so that the logistics cost incurred on procurement can be reduced and agri commodities can be procured at a less logistic cost,” reads the letter. Similarly, the DEA and DOE said that technology upgradation in cultivation, R&amp;D and mechanisation of farming needs to be focused upon to improve agricultural productivity. \"Improvement in marketing platforms for small and marginal farmers by promoting and strengthening FPOs (Farmer Produce Organizations), cooperatives and self-help groups (SHGs) needs priority,\" reads the letter further. In response to these, the Ministry of Agriculture said that it is implementing Agri Infra Fund (AIF) to address the existing infrastructure gaps and mobilise investment in agricultural infrastructure. It further said that the Sub-Mission in Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) is being implemented for creating high-tech farm equipment. Regarding marketing platforms, the ministry said that it is implementing the Marketing Research and Information Network, a sub-scheme of Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM), to link important agricultural produce markets spread all over the country. The Ministry has estimated to procure around 828 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of 14 agricultural produce this kharif season, out of which expected procurement of Paddy alone is 806 LMT. However, the fact is that the procurement of Rice, which recorded a continuous increase from 31.8 million tonnes in 2013-14 to 60.2 million tonnes in 2020-21, witnessed a decline during the last three seasons. The increase in MSP for paddy this season is 5.40 per cent (Rs. 117 per quintal) as the cost of production went up by 5.4 per cent over last year.",

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/11/RBI_84780d.jpg",
    "description1": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which is scheduled to meet from December 4 to 6, is likely to keep the repo rate – the key policy rate – unchanged at 6.5 per cent in the meeting. This would be the 11th consecutive monetary policy, or for 22 months, that the repo rate would have been left unchanged. The six-member MPC may also retain the monetary policy stance as ‘neutral’ in the upcoming policy, economists said. The MPC’s decision is expected to be announced on December 6. What is RBI likely to announce in the December policy? The rate-setting panel will meet against a backdrop of growing concerns over slowing economic growth and elevated inflationary pressures. These two factors will likely weigh on the MPC’s decision in its December 6 policy announcement. “Given the rather uncertain global environment and the possible impact on inflation and the fact that currently inflation has been averaging close to 5.9 per cent in the last two months, a status quo on the repo rate will be the logical outcome from the policy,” said Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda. The recent data released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) showed that the country’s real gross domestic product (GDP) slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4 per cent in July-September 2024. This compares with a growth of 6.7 per cent in the April-June 2024 quarter and 8.1 per cent in the July-September 2023 period. Consumer price-based inflation (CPI), or retail inflation, surged to a 14-month high of 6.21 per cent in October 2024, compared to 5.5 per cent in September. “RBI is expected to remain on pause in December 2024, with upside risk to food inflation in the near-term. Overall headline CPI inflation in Q3FY25 is averaging closer to 6 per cent versus RBI’s estimate of 4.8 per cent. Subdued core inflation shows that inflation pressures remain localised due to presence of negative output gap,” said Gaura Sengupta, Chief Economist, IDFC FIRST Bank. Goldman Sachs also expects the RBI to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent at the December 6 policy meeting as a base case. Can there be a change in monetary policy stance? The Reserve Bank’s MPC changed the policy stance from “withdrawal of accommodation” to “neutral” in the October 2024 policy. The RBI may not tweak the stance in the forthcoming policy, analysts said. “We further expect the RBI to retain the ‘neutral’ policy stance and remain “unambiguously focused on durably aligning inflation to the target, while supporting growth”,” Goldman Sachs said in the report. In the last policy meeting, the MPC changed ",
    "description2": "the monetary policy stance to 'neutral', after keeping it as 'withdrawal of accommodation' for 28 straight months. The neutral stance indicates that conditions are now congenial for a cut in the repo rate in the near future. Growing clamour for repo rate cut Recently, two Union ministers have called for a cut in the repo rate. Last month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman batted for “affordable bank interest rates” to support industries to ramp up and build capacities. “…at a time when we want industries to ramp up and build capacities, bank interest rates will have to be far more affordable,” Sitharaman had said at an event while responding to a question on whether she expects a reduction in interest rates soon or if there could be a delay in the cut given current inflation print. Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, had also urged the RBI to cut interest rates to boost economic growth and look through food prices while deciding on monetary policy. Will RBI revise inflation and GDP projections? There could be a change in RBI projections for both inflation and GDP as inflation has been higher so far than the RBI forecast for Q3 and GDP growth is expected to be lower in Q2, said Bank of Baroda’s Sabnavis. “It would hence be of interest to see what the projections this time are,” he said. The RBI has projected real GDP growth for 2024-25 at 7.2 per cent with Q2 at 7 per cent; Q3 at 7.4 per cent; and Q4 at 7.4 per cent. The forecast for CPI is 4.5 per cent for 2024-25, with Q2 at 4.1 per cent; Q3 at 4.8 per cent; and Q4 at 4.2 per cent According to IDFC FIRST Bank’s Sengupta, there could be a downside risk to RBI’s FY25 GDP growth estimate of 7.2 per cent and upside risk to FY25 CPI inflation estimate of 4.5 per cent. So, what happens to lending rates if the repo rate is left steady? If the RBI leaves the repo rate steady at 6.5 per cent, all external benchmark lending rates (EBLR) linked to the repo rate will not increase, giving relief to borrowers as their equated monthly instalments (EMIs) will not increase. However, lenders may raise interest rates on loans that are linked to the marginal cost of fund-based lending rate (MCLR), where the full transmission of a 250 bps hike in the repo rate between May 2022 and February 2023 has not happened. In response to the 250 bps hike in the policy repo rate since May 2022, banks have revised upwards their repo-linked external benchmark-based lending rates (EBLRs) by a similar magnitude. The median 1-year marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) of SCBs has increased by 170 bps during May 2022 to October 2024.",

    "description1": "Around 16,282 pension payment orders have been issued so far by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) to members and pensioners who had applied for higher pension under the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) after the November 2022 Supreme Court ruling. Even as the retirement fund body has rejected 2.6 lakh forms for higher pension, over 6 lakh applications for validation of option and joint options from employers and employees are still under examination by the EPFO’s field offices. While the EPFO has not specified the total financial impact of the rollout of the higher pension option, it said the sample data of around 38,000 applicants for pension on higher wages shows a deficit of around Rs 9,500 crore, that is, approximately Rs 25 lakh per person. It means a member has to shell out Rs 25 lakh on an average if he/she has opted for the higher pension option based on the sample figures. “An initial estimate suggested that approximately a sum of Rs 1,86,920 crore will be depleted out of the Fund on settlement of even as less as 50 per cent of the joint option (post 2014 cases) received,” said a note shared by the EPFO on the current status of the implementation of the higher pension scheme in the 236th meeting of the EPFO’s Central Board of Trustees held Saturday. The EPFO said the actuarial analysis can be completed only after all the applications for validation of joint options are processed. A total of 17.49 lakh applications were received for the higher pension option after the Supreme Court directed the EPFO to open a window for pensioners and members to apply for it. The SC in a ruling on November 4, 2022 had upheld the amendments to the Employees’ Pension (Amendment) Scheme, 2014, providing another chance for employees who were existing EPS members as on September 1, 2014, to contribute up to 8.33 per cent of their ‘actual’ salaries — as against 8.33 per cent of the pensionable salary capped at Rs 15,000 a month — towards pension. Given the high number of pending applications for higher pension, the ",
    "description2": "EPFO is aiming for a timeline of next three months to process all the applications. To speed up the process, the EPFO is considering engaging retired officials for work. Out of the total 17.49 lakh applications received by the EPFO for higher pension, 3.12 lakh forms are pending with the employers. Thus, the net number of applications received in EPFO has been 14.37 lakh, out of which 2.7 lakh are by pensioners who retired prior to 01.09.2014, while 11.67 lakh applications are for validation of joint options by employees who were EPS members as on 01.09.2014. Demand letters have been issued to just 21 pensioners (those who retired before 01.09.2014), while 1.19 lakh demand letters have been sent to the members who were employees as on 01.09.2014. Pensioners, who retired before 01.09.2014, saw a higher rejection number with 1.91 lakh rejected forms compared with rejection of 69,767 forms of employees who were EPS members as on 01.09.2014. Pensioners also saw a lower issuance of pension payment orders with just 4 orders as against 16,278 payment orders issued to employees. In case of some exempted establishments, the EPFO said the trust rules have mentioned that the contributions to the pension fund and the provident fund would be restricted to the wage ceiling. The EPFO had kept the deadline to apply for higher pension till July 11 last year. It had then given further time of three months to employers till September 30, 2023 and then another extension till December 31, 2023, while employees had time till July 11, 2023 to submit their applications. Applications that are complete with the required information are processed and demand letters issued by the EPFO indicate the additional due amounts to the pension fund. If the applicants for higher pension under EPS have the due amount available in their provident fund accounts maintained with the EPFO, then only a diversion is required. In cases where the due amount is not available with the EPFO, then it has to be deposited by the member directly or through the employer.",

    "description1": "A redemption policy for investments in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and reinvestment of 50 per cent of those redemption proceeds into ETFs, along with an amnesty scheme for employers to voluntarily disclose and rectify past non-compliance without penalties was approved by the Central Board of Trustees of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) in its 236th meeting Saturday. The Board also discussed the pilot of the Centralised Pension Payment System (CPPS), which is likely to be launched on December 31. The EPFO, which has 7.37 crore contributing subscribers and a total of 32.56 crore members, plans to increase the ETF redemption period to 7 years from 4 years over the next six years to improve yields. While 50 per cent of the redemption proceeds will get reinvested in equity through ETFs such as Bharat 22 and CPSE ETFs, the remaining 50 per cent would be invested in other asset classes as per the existing pattern such as government securities and corporate bonds. The changes in investment norms is being done with an aim to earn better returns through investment in equity. The investment committee of the EPFO had earlier noted that “there is a need to balance the short-term returns on investments under EPF Scheme with the future growth prospects in equity”. As per the notified pattern of investment by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the EPFO can invest up to 15 per cent of its incremental flows in equity. EPFO started with an investment of 5 per cent in equity through ETFs on Sensex or Nifty in August 2015. Subsequently from 2017 the investment in ETFs was increased to 15 per cent of the fresh accretion. The 44-member CBT, headed by Labour and Employ",
    "description2": "ment Minister Mansukh Mandaviya and having both employees’ and employers’ representatives, also gave nod for the EPFO Amnesty Scheme 2024. The scheme is being brought as the Labour and Employment Ministry moves ahead with the implementation plan for the Budget announcement of Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) scheme. “The initiative is designed to encourage employers to voluntarily disclose and rectify past non-compliance or under-compliance without facing penalties or legal repercussions. A simple online declaration from employers will be sufficient to avail the scheme benefits,” the Ministry said in a statement. The amnesty scheme has been proposed in the backdrop that several small establishments, especially Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), may opt for the ELI scheme but would have faced a roadblock if there were past dues of non-compliance for EPF contribution. The CBT also approved a key feature of crediting interest at the time of claim settlements. At present, for the claim settled till 24th of the month, interest is paid only up to the end of the previous month. Now, the interest will be paid to the member up to the date of settlement. The Board also discussed the earlier decision to increase the limit for auto claims settlement facility to Rs 1 lakh from Rs 50,000 which is now applicable for advances for housing, marriage and education. In the current financial year 2024-25, the EPFO has settled 1.15 crore claims in auto mode. “During the Financial Year 2023-24, the EPFO settled 4.45 crore claims for an amount of Rs 1.82 lakh crore. In the current FY, 3.83 crore claims have already been settled for more than Rs.1.57 lakh crore,” the Ministry said.",

    "description1": "Setting the stage to counter any challenge to the dollar’s domination in global trade, US President-elect Donald Trump has threatened the BRICS grouping, which has India, Russia and China among its key members, with “100 per cent tariffs” if it moved to create a new currency or back any other option as the world’s reserve. “The idea that the BRICS countries are trying to move away from the dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER,” Trump wrote in a social media post early Sunday. “We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency nor back any other currency to replace the mighty U.S. dollar, or they will face 100 per cent tariffs and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. economy. They can go find another ‘sucker!’ There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the US dollar in international trade, and any country that tries should wave goodbye to America,” Trump posted. With the USD accounting for over 90 per cent of global transactions, Trump's latest remarks come amid divergent views on the issue at the BRICS summit in October. At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin had warned that the “dollar is being used as a weapon”. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi had cautioned that the grouping should not acquire the image of one that is trying to replace global institutions. Trump’s threat also comes at a time when US sanctions on Russia have resulted in Russian oil being redirected from Europe to Asia. However, international trade experts warn that any such tariff move by the US would “ultimately hurt America the most”. According to them, several countries have been looking at other “mechanisms” after the US “weaponised the global financial infrastructure” by throwing Iran and Russia out of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), which is the key to international transactions. “It is the actions of the United States that have pushed many countries to seek alternatives to the US dollar. The US has a history of leveraging its influence over global financial systems, such as the SWIFT network, to impose unilateral sanctions. By blocking countries like Russia and Iran from accessing SWIFT, the US has effectively weaponised the global financial infrastructure, forcing other nations to find alternative payment mechanisms to continue legitimate trade,” former trade officer and head of the think tank, Global Trade Research Initiative, Ajay Srivastava, said. Srivastava also said that imposing a 100 per cent tariff on BRICS countries could backfire economically. “Imports into the US would simply shift to third countries, potentially increasing costs for American consumers without bringing manufacturing jobs back home. The US has become less competitive in manufacturing labour-intensive goods due to higher production costs, and tariffs are unlikely to reverse this trend,” he said. BRICS stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the original five members. This year, the group admitted four new members - Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and UAE - and now represents almost half the world’s population and almost one quarter of its economy. Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) Director General &amp; CEO Ajay Sahai said that India should engage diplomatically with the US to explain its position, emphasising that diversifying trade mechanisms is not anti-American but a move towards multipolarity and financial stability. “We should accelerate the development and internationalisation of digital currency (CBDC) and financial platforms like UPI to take a leadership role in BRICS currency initiatives. Trump’s threat might am",
    "description2": "plify geopolitical tensions, but it is unlikely to deter BRICS nations from pursuing alternatives to the US dollar. For India, the best course is a balanced approach: supporting financial reforms within BRICS that align with its interests while maintaining strong ties with the US to safeguard its broader strategic and economic priorities,” Sahai said. Meanwhile, the IMF’s Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) has pointed to a gradual decline in the dollar’s share of central bank and government foreign reserves. But the reduced role of the US dollar over the past two decades has not been matched by corresponding increases in the shares of the other “big four” currencies, the euro, yen and pound, according to the IMF. “Rather, this has been accompanied by a rise in the share of what we refer to as non-traditional reserve currencies, including the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, South Korean won, Singaporean dollar, and the Nordic currencies,” the IMF said in July. Significantly, the IMF also said that one non-traditional reserve currency gaining market share is the Chinese renminbi, whose gains match a quarter of the decline in the dollar’s share. “The Chinese government has been advancing policies on multiple fronts to promote renminbi internationalization, including the development of a cross-border payment system, the extension of swap lines, and piloting a central bank digital currency. It is thus interesting to note that renminbi internationalization, at least as measured by the currency’s reserve share, shows signs of stalling out,” IMF said about the key BRICS member. “China is very keen to assume a dominant role to use the (BRICS) bloc against the US, though India, Brazil and South Africa are more keen to work with the US and settle the differences amicably through negotiations,” FIEO chief Sahai said. In India, an effort to reduce reliance on the US dollar and internationalise the rupee saw the RBI allowing invoicing and payments for global trade in rupees in 2022 after sanctions were imposed on Russia amid the Ukraine war. According to the BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey 2022, foreign exchange market turnover - daily averages - shows that the US dollar accounted for 88 per cent of the global forex turnover while the rupee accounted for 1.6 per cent. The survey stated that if rupee turnover rises to equal the share of non-US, non-Euro currencies in global forex turnover of 4 per cent, it will be regarded as an international currency. But India’s trade with Russia in domestic currency remains low due to Indian banks' fear of US sanctions and an unbalanced trade relationship between the two countries. While there has been a multifold rise in India-Russia trade after the Ukraine war, it has been firmly in favour of Russia. According to official data, India’s exports to Russia stood at $4.2 billion in FY24, but increasing oil imports from Moscow have widened the import bill to $61 billion. As a result, Russia has a huge pile of rupee reserves that it has not been able to use to settle bilateral trade using domestic currency and is instead using it to invest in Indian stocks and bonds. In October, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said that while India is pursuing its trade interests, avoiding the use of the US dollar is not part of economic policy. Jaishankar said US policies often complicate trade with certain countries, and India is seeking “workarounds” without intending to move away from using the dollar, unlike some other nations. However, the Union Minister did add that a multipolar world will eventually be reflected in “currencies and economic dealings”.",

    "description1": "After growing at a robust 52 per cent annually since the Covid-19 pandemic, residential launches across India’s top real estate markets fell by 2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This marks the sector’s first slowdown since the post-2020 boom, with just one ticket size bucking the trend – luxury units priced above Rs 2.5 crore. The growing premiumisation of India’s residential real estate sector amidst easing demand is also evident in sales, which fell by 3 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) between April and September 2024, while the average ticket size of units sold grew by 23 per cent, an analysis of data from Anarock showed. In the Delhi-NCR market, where demand for luxury housing is especially pronounced, sales fell by 0.6 per cent while the average price of units sold surged by 56 per cent. The first signs of a slowdown in residential real estate mirror recent concerns around waning urban demand across sectors, from automobiles to consumer goods. Major developers have announced plans to transition away from affordable housing as they no longer see a business opportunity in the segment. Even in the upper-end Rs 1.5-2.5 crore segment, launches fell by 15 per cent y-o-y in the first three quarters of 2024, as against doubling each year between 2020 and 2023. Strong demand for luxury housing Launches of residential units priced above Rs 2.5 crore across the top seven cities—including the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, and Chennai—surged at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 116 per cent between 2020 and 2023, marking an unprecedented boom in luxury housing. From just 4,000 such units in 2020, launches soared to over 41,000 in 2023. Even in the first three quarters of 2024, when overall residential launches declined by 2 per cent, luxury launches displayed notable resilience, growing by 56 per cent to over 52,000 units. After the pandemic, housing became increasingly aspirational for urban Indians, with mid-segment buyers gravitating toward projects offering superior amenities and better connectivity. Demand for larger homes with flexible configurations, such as additional rooms, has also risen sharply. Reflecting this trend, the average flat size grew from 1,167 square feet in 2020 to 1,300 square feet in 2023—a rise of 11.4 per cent, according to data from Anarock. In an earnings call last month, Aakash Ohri, Joint MD at DLF Ltd, noted that demand for luxury housing is no longer confined by a north-south geographic divide. “I have seen in super luxury, including our projects in Goa and of course, Camellias, it has been pan-India. The recent sales and the interest that I'm seeing is coming from top families of Tier 2 cities all over the country… I feel that the start point is where we are today. It is only going to go up,” Ohri said. Others are more cautious–Jagadish Nangineni, MD of Bangalore-headquartered Sobha Ltd, believes that luxury sales may begin to s",
    "description2": "tabilise. “I think there is a steadiness in the market and probably what we can anticipate is not (what) we have seen (with) the increase in the sales volumes in the last couple of years. Probably we are reaching a steady state instead of continuous increase in terms of demand,” Nangineni told analysts on November 15. Developers pivot from affordable housing Between 2020 and 2023, launches below Rs 40 lakh grew at the slowest CAGR of 29 per cent to a little over 83,000 units. The next ticket size – launches priced between Rs 40 lakh and Rs 1.5 crore – grew at 50 per cent to around 2,60,000 units. Growth in both these ticket sizes was lower than the overall CAGR of 52 per cent. In the first three quarters of 2024, launches below Rs 40 lakh fell by 10 per cent and those between Rs 40 lakh and Rs 1.5 crore fell by 7 per cent. The latest data reflects what developers have been saying for some time – both demand and margins are higher in the premium segments. Soaring input costs and land prices have also made affordable projects in and around metropolitan cities harder to execute. Abhishek Lodha, MD and CEO of Macrotech Developers Ltd, reiterated the company’s “planned transition” away from entry-level housing towards the “upper end of the mid-income and beyond” in a recent earnings call. “As a consequence of that… we will be moving from a tilt of about 85% to 90% of our sales coming from lower mid-income and entry-level housing to that moving to 50%, obviously, over a period of 3 years,” Lodha said. Amit Kumar Sinha, MD and CEO of Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd, also confirmed that the company “will not pursue affordable anymore”. “So, that segment is out. And while super luxury and all are very exciting, our focus is going to mid-premium and premium. And the way we segment the market is affordable, mid-premium, premium and luxury… we will play in the middle 2 segments, we will not play in the 2 extreme segments,” Sinha told analysts last month. Pavitra Shankar, MD of Brigade Enterprises Ltd said on November 14 – “If in future, there was affordable housing, we would look at that, too, if there was opportunity there. But currently, there is a lot of demand in terms of premiumization of consumer demand itself, whether real estate or any sector. So that's why we are capitalizing on this trend.” Among top 7 cities, Delhi-NCR recorded the steepest rise in the average price of units sold, which surged to Rs 1.45 crore between April to September 2024 from Rs 0.93 crore during the same period in 2023. On the other hand, sales fell slightly by 0.6 per cent to 32,125 units. In Bangalore, the average price of units sold jumped by 44 per cent to Rs 1.21 crore while sales fell 0.2 per cent to 31,380 units. The MMR region was the only exception among major cities to record a positive growth in units sold – from 76,410 to 77,735 units, a growth of 1.7 per cent. The average price of units sold in and around Mumbai also did not change from Rs 1.47 crore.",

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/11/RBI_84780d.jpg",
    "description1": "Early signs of stress in India's microfinance institutions, small finance lenders, and unsecured personal loans are beginning to show up, primarily driven by escalating borrower indebtedness. Latest data reveals a surge in delinquencies during the first half of FY25, with multiple analysts predicting this trend to persist into the next half year, casting a shadow over the asset quality of underlying loans. As a result, small and micro loans face significant risks to their growth and profitability, sparking concerns about the sector's resilience in these challenging times, analysts and rating agencies said. On November 13, ESAF Small Finance Bank, which used to focus on micro loans, reported a jump in gross non-performing assets (NPAs) to Rs 1,279.3 crore (6.9 per cent of advances) for the quarter ended September 2024 from Rs 399.1 crore (2.6 per cent) a year ago due to its concentration on micro loans. Its share price has plummeted from a 52-week high of Rs 82.26 to Rs 39.01 now. Aviom India Housing Finance informed its lenders earlier this month about an ongoing audit by the National Housing Bank (NHB) in the wake of the discovery of fraudulent transactions during a recent onsite supervisory inspection. Saying that there could be a delay in repayments to creditors, Aviom said in a letter to lenders that, “the NHB audit was initiated following the regular on-site supervisory inspection that resulted in observations, including that the statement of accounts of mutual fund(s) appear to be managed.” CRISIL has estimated that the gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of small finance banks (SFBs) are expected to move up to 2.9 per cent by the end of fiscal 2025 from 2.3 per cent as on March 31, 2024. “As a result, credit cost is set to rise 40 bps (basis points) to 1.4 per cent. The impact of the expected delinquency trends will not be uniform, though. The extent of rise in gross NPAs and credit costs across SFBs will vary based on the extent of their exposure to the vulnerable segments,” said Vani Ojasvi, associate director, CRISIL Ratings. Indicating the rising indebtedness, credit card outstanding rose to Rs 2.71 lakh crore by September 2024 from Rs 2.30 lakh crore in September last year. The Reserve Bank of India stepped in to check the rampant rise in the indebtedness and delinquencies in the personal loan segment with more restrictions last year, leading to a decline in the growth in the overall personal loan book of banks to 5 per cent as of September this year from 18 per cent a year ago. ICRA said delinquencies in the microfinance institutions (MFI) sector rose to 2.4 per cent by June 2024 from 2.1 per cent in March, while highlighting the increasing delinquencies in the microfinance sector, which is likely to push up the NBFC-MFI credit costs to 320-340 bps — one basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point — in FY25 from 220 bps in FY24. The evolving asset quality risks will dampen sectoral growth and earnings in the current fiscal. ICRA expects NBFC-MFIs’ assets under management (AUM) growth to dip to 17-19 per cent in FY25 from 29 per cent in FY24. Microfinance institutions faced a significant rise in delinquencies during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, according to Crisil. Early-stage delinquencies (0+ and 30+ days past due) increased by 110 basis points and 55 basis points, respectively, compared to the preceding March quarter. Four key factors contributed to this decline in portfolio quality: lending to over-leveraged borrowers, debt-waiver campaigns, high field-staff attrition, and operational challenges due to elections and extreme weather. As a result, average monthly collection efficiency dropped to 96 per cent in Q1 FY25 and further to 94 per cent in Q2, down from 98 per cent in the previous fiscal, CRISIL said. According to Jyoti Prakash Gadia, managing director, Resurgent India, while the banking industry as a whole is showing resilience with a gradually reduced NPA, stress is visible in microfinance, small finance, and unsecured loans. “This is primarily because of the relatively more aggressive approach adopted by these institutions in granting loans. The risk assessment and compliance criteria have been apparently diluted with the element of flexibility in selecting the borrowers,” Gadia said. Target hunting with an intent to expand quickly has prompted sanctions on some borrowers who did not have adequate cash flows to fall back upon for repayment, leading to stress. The overall economic scenario at the rural and semi-urban level has also not improved to a level of buoyancy, thereby creating stress for small loans, Gadia said. In fiscal 2025, microfinance loans and unsecured personal loans, where early signs of stress are visible on account of a rise in borrower indebtedness, will see a moderation in portfolio quality. Sub-segments within secured asset classes, catering in part to a similar customer segment, could also see higher delinquencies, CRISIL said. The RBI has recently imposed a ‘cease and desist order’ on some NBFC-MFIs, preventing them from sanctioning and disbursing loans. “The re",
    "description2": "strictions were due to issues related to predatory pricing, insufficient transparency in disclosures, and improper evaluation of household income and fixed monthly liabilities. Additionally, concerns have been raised about lending to customers with multiple fake voter IDs, often categorised as new-to-credit (NTC) customers, which further undermines the integrity of the lending process,” CareEdge Ratings said in a report. In October, the RBI cautioned non-banking finance companies against aggressively pursuing growth without building up sustainable business practices and risk management frameworks, commensurate with the scale and complexity of their portfolio. “The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring these areas and will not hesitate to take appropriate action, if necessary,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said. Driven by the significant accretion to their capital from both domestic and overseas sources, and sometimes under pressure from their investors, some NBFCs — including microfinance institutions (MFIs) and housing finance companies (HFCs) — are “chasing excessive returns on their equity”, he said. Furthermore, the RBI has raised concerns regarding the practice of loan netting by MFIs and has instructed certain banks and MFIs to ensure that this does not lead to ‘ever-greening of delinquent loans’. The increasing borrower indebtedness is compounded by various factors, such as heatwaves, general elections, and political movements like the “Karja Mukti Abhiyan (loan waiver scheme).” This challenge is further aggravated by the weakening of the joint liability group model, characterised by a notable decrease in centre attendance and diminished peer pressure and collective accountability, which have historically helped maintain low default rates, CareEdge said. The profitability of small finance banks, measured in terms of return on assets (RoA), will moderate around 40 bps to 1.7 per cent this fiscal from 2.1 per cent for FY24 due to lower net interest margins (NIM) and higher credit costs, CRISIL said. The overall profitability will continue to be significantly influenced by credit costs. Small finance banks are bracing for a potential surge in delinquencies and credit costs, driven by economic stress, and rising borrower indebtedness. SFBs, catering to relatively vulnerable customers, tend to experience higher delinquencies during economic downturns, as witnessed during the pandemic. \"Early signs of stress are visible in microfinance and unsecured personal loans due to increasing borrower indebtedness,\" CRISIL noted. \"SFBs must proactively manage risk and tighten lending norms to mitigate potential losses,\" it said. “The challenge is higher for unsecured asset classes such as personal loans, business loans, and MFIs. The impact on the MFI segment is higher,” said Sanjay Aggarwal, senior director, CARE Ratings. He expects credit cost for NBFC-MFIs to be at 7 per cent in FY2025, compared to 2.5 per cent in FY24. Analysts see a significant slowdown in the loan book of NBFCs due to the higher base effect, the reduction in bank funding to NBFCs and the tightening of underwriting standards by non-bank lenders. “Overall, there will be a slowdown in the loan growth of NBFCs as bank funding to these entities has reduced. The lower funding is because the RBI wants growth in retail loans to come down as certain borrowers are overleveraged, which increases the risk of higher defaults,” said a banking analyst. CAUTIOUS APPROACH NEEDED The expectations of significant improvements in future earnings and social aspirations have led to a substantial increase in unsecured borrowings by new consumers, and this portfolio, particularly of NBFCs and microfinance institutions, has grown faster. The delinquencies have correspondingly grown in the absence of adequate generation of income and surplus impacting the repayment capacity, Gadia said. Experts said it’s a matter of concern and a careful approach with brakes on fresh sanctions in these segments is needed. In addition, stronger recovery efforts are also called for to bring in control of the overall position. The regulator has taken suitable steps in this direction to maintain the desired balance and order in the portfolio. The small loan industry faces significant challenges beyond financial and operational risks, including high staff turnover and rising fraud, both of which disrupt client relationships and loan recovery. These issues, coupled with vulnerabilities to socio-political risks and natural disasters, further complicate the already difficult operating environment for NBFC-MFIs, making 2025 a challenging year ahead. However, despite operating in a vulnerable segment, the NBFC-MFI sector has consistently shown resilience, overcoming challenges like Covid-19 and demonetisation. Its ability to recover and adapt has earned continued investor support, highlighting the sector's strength and its critical role in financial inclusion. CareEdge Ratings expect that the sector will also navigate through the current stress and continue playing a vital role in serving underserved communities.",

    "description1": "Vodafone Idea share price today: Vodafone Idea (Vi) shares surged 18.08% to Rs 8.23 on the BSE during early Tuesday trading, following the Union Cabinet's in-principle approval regarding the company's bank guarantee matter. At 2:53 PM, shares of Vi were trading at Rs 7.59, up 8.74%.The Cabinet offered relief to telecommunications firms by eliminating bank guarantee requirements for spectrum acquisitions through 2022. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had supported this waiver for spectrum purchases. The reforms of 2021 had already removed bank guarantee requirements for auctions from 2022 onwards. Vi's total bank guarantee obligation stands at Rs 24,700 crore, with the spectrum auction dues moratorium concluding in October 2025.Vodafone Idea defaulted on its second bank guarantee (BG) payment of approximately Rs 350 crore on November 1, relating to spectrum acquired in the 2012 auction.

Whilst competitors Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio also require BG submissions for previous auction payments, their obligations are considerably smaller than Vi's.Bharti Airtel faces a BG payment of roughly Rs 2,200 crore due in September next year for the 2016 auction. Jio's obligation of approximately Rs 4,400 crore follows afterwards.Vi requested the waiver citing financial constraints, anticipating that this would enable banks to extend additional credit facilities to the company.Following this development, Bharti Airtel shares increased by 1.6% to Rs 1,604.95, whilst Jio Financial Services shares declined nearly 1% to Rs 320.10 on the BSE.",

    "description1": "PAN 2.0: The Modi government has approved a new PAN 2.0 project and the first question that comes to the mind of taxpayers is, should they apply for the upgraded PAN Card under PAN 2.0? A free application option for a new PAN will be available for those needing to correct or update their details, such as name or date of birth. It’s important to note that the Income Tax Department has issued a statement confirming that current PAN cardholders need not mandatorily obtain a new PAN under the PAN 2.0 initiative. Should you replace old PAN with new PAN Card under PAN 2.0?Experts are of the view that individuals holding older white PAN cards or PAN cards without QR codes should obtain the newer version featuring a QR code. Experts believe that the updated PAN card design with PAN 2.0 will reduce fraud risks through its integrated QR code whilst enabling quick verification.What are the benefits of PAN Card with QR Code?Vikram Babbar, Partner, EY Forensic & Integrity Services - Financial Services told ET, \"Upgrading to the new PAN card design with a QR code is a proactive step for users to safeguard their identity and financial information. It helps reduce the likelihood of falling prey to fraudulent activities.\"Supporting this perspective, Ankit Ratan, CEO & Co-founder, Signzy - an online identity verification and customer onboarding company told ET, \"Under the PAN 2.0 initiative, the entire process of PAN application has been digitized. This enables provision of seamless PAN authentication and validation services to various organisations, including financial institutions, banks, and governmental bodies at both central and state levels.\"Also Read | PAN 2.0 FAQs answered! Will your PAN Card change, will it have a new number? Income Tax Department releases top 10 pointsAccording to Babbar, the QR code integration with PAN Card offers several advantages to taxpayers:Strengthened Security Features: The incorporation of QR code technology in the new PAN card significantly reduces vulnerability to duplication or alteration. The encrypted personal information within the QR code is accessible solely to authorised personnel with specific software. This security measure prevents fraudsters from modifying names and photographs whilst retaining the original PAN number. Financial institutions ",
    "description2": "can utilise the QR code to authenticate the printed information.Efficient Authentication Process: Identity verification becomes streamlined through the QR code scanning feature on the updated PAN card. The immediate verification process serves as protection against identity theft and impersonation. This functionality proves particularly valuable during financial transactions by reducing errors and fraudulent activities.Current Information Maintenance: The upgraded PAN card ensures user details conform to the Income Tax Department's latest formatting requirements.Regulatory Adherence: Users who obtain the redesigned PAN card align with the government's updated identification protocols, supporting a more secure financial system.Fraud Prevention: The technical complexity involved in accurately reproducing QR codes creates a significant barrier for fraudsters attempting to duplicate PAN cards.Ratan from Signzy, Ratan, explains that the new PAN card design incorporating a QR code represents a crucial advancement in fraud prevention and regulatory adherence. The QR code technology provides enhanced security and verification capabilities by storing encrypted information about the cardholder. The sophisticated encryption makes PAN card replication virtually impossible, as the QR code verification requires authorised software, confirming the card's authenticity and proper ownership, he says.A contrasting perspective comes from Sandeep Jhunjhunwala of Nangia Andersen LLP, who notes, \"Printed PAN cards carry QR code on them, now as well. Hence, while an upgrade to a new PAN card could be done anytime, it may not necessarily mean that under PAN 2.0 project, this would always protect the taxpayer against any potential fraud. The new system is expected to include features such as mandatory Aadhaar linkage, real-time validation and advanced data analytics, all of which could potentially help in identifying and preventing frauds. However, it remains unclear now as to how effectively these features would address the potential of fraud. As PAN 2.0 evolves, stakeholders could watch out for further updates from the authorities to understand how these features would be implemented and whether additional measures would be introduced to specifically tackle the menace of financial frauds.\"115804021",

    "description1": "Indian bonds are set for the best year in four and investors expect more gains on a combination of policy drivers and resilient domestic demand.The central bank’s rate cuts anticipated from early next year on slowing economic growth, continued index-inclusion-related foreign inflows and strong demand from local pension and insurance companies are likely to further burnish the appeal of sovereign notes.Quantum Asset Management forecasts the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond to fall as much as 50 basis points by mid-2025, while Trust Mutual Fund sees the rate sliding toward 6.25%-6.5% over the next year and a half.While a resurgent dollar and higher Treasury yields have dented the appeal of emerging-market assets in recent weeks on concerns about US President-elect Donald Trump’s policies, Indian bonds have remained largely insulated.Even as “there are headwinds from a stronger dollar and higher US Treasury yields, the ongoing bond index inclusion flows are likely to provide sustained solid passive support to Indian bonds,” Barclays Plc strategists including Mitul Kotecha wrote in a note.Indian Bonds Set for Best Year in FourThe yield on the 10-year bond fell by nine basis points on Friday to close at 6.74%, a few basis points lower than early November when the US election results were announced.Bonds rallied on Friday after data showed Ind",
    "description2": "ia’s gross domestic product grew at its slowest pace in almost two years, stoking hopes of liquidity-easing measures or interest-rate cuts by the central bank.That’s not to say the market has been free of volatility. Yields rose to 6.87% on Nov. 22, the highest in more than two months, as some global investors chose to cash in until further clarity on Trump’s policy. The rush of inflows driven by the nation’s inclusion in JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s flagship index is also taking a breather.Notwithstanding the short-term swings, 10-year yields are down more than 40 basis points this year, the most since 2020. That happened as local bonds received about $15 billion of foreign inflows during the period, aided by the JPMorgan gauge addition.India’s index-eligible bonds are also due to find a place in other global indexes, including those of FTSE Russell from next year, potentially attracting more foreign inflows.While the Reserve Bank of India is likely to keep its policy rate unchanged on Dec. 6, traders will watch for cues on when it will start cutting rates. The RBI changed its policy stance to neutral in its most recent rate decision in October.Swaps are pricing in 50 basis points of rate cuts by June 2025, said Pankaj Pathak, a fixed-income fund manager at Quantum Asset. Bonds are likely to gain on the easing and higher foreign inflows, he said.",

    "description1": "Rating agency Crisil has projected India's GDP growth to decline from 8.2 percent last year to 6.8 percent in the current fiscal year 2024-2025, pressured by rising interest rates and limited fiscal stimulus.The report mentioned that risks are tilted toward the downside given the lacklustre second-quarter growth numbers.However, many high-frequency indicators from October, such as automobile sales and export growth, still show a positive outlook for the third quarter, suggesting that the slowdown in the second quarter may be temporary.Official data from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, released on Friday, revealed that the economy grew by 5.4 percent during the July-September quarter compared to 8.1 percent during the corresponding quarter last fiscal year.Meanwhile, in the April-June quarter, the economy grew by 6.7 percent, falling short of the RBI's forecast of 7.1 percent.Meanwhile, on a positive note, agricultural growth in the country is rising, with significant potential for further expansion",
    "description2": ". This growth is driven by expectations of strong kharif cultivation, owing to a healthy monsoon season that ended 8 percent above the Long Period Average.“All this should provide a fillip to agricultural incomes and rural consumption,” Crisil stated.Additionally, the abundant supply of kharif crops in the market is expected to help reduce food prices, which have been high in recent months, affecting the purchasing power of both rural and urban households. October’s food inflation was primarily driven by rising vegetable, oil, and fruit prices.“Easing inflation, along with the onset of the festive and wedding season, is likely to buoy consumption growth in the second half of this fiscal year,” the report added.India’s retail inflation in October stood at 6.21 percent, breaching the RBI’s upper limit of 6 percent.Food prices remain a major concern for policymakers in India, who aim to bring retail inflation down to a sustainable 4 percent. To keep inflation under control, the RBI has maintained the repo rate at 6.5 percent.",
