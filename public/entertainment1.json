    "description1": "It's very rare to see Shahid Kapoor open up about his personal life. However, the actor has had his own fair share of ups and downs in his personal and professional life. In a recent conversation with Faye D'Souza on her Youtube channel, Shahid, who had a long term relationship with actor Kareena Kapoor Khan, got candid about 'crying' on sets, due to a 'heartbreak'. When asked if he has ever wept in a room alone because of his career, Shahid answered, \"That only happened to me when I went through heartbreak. And, sometimes it happens when you are making movies. So, I have had that. It was really bad. My makeup guy was like, 'I just finished your makeup! Can you just not?'\" The actor instantly started explaining his state while talking in a weeping tone, 'I can't help it, I think I am destroying myself'. \"I have been through those but not for work,\" he added. ALSO READ | Mira Rajput on how husband Shahid Kapoor has changed ‘spiritually’ over the years, blames him for spoiling their kids: ‘I am the bad cop’ The actor also talked about the one thing men need to change in their life. \"Indian men especially, have been kind of told from a very young age that you have to be the provider, that yo",
    "description2": "u have to protect and be the man of the family. Its there in men, when you are always worried that whatever I love, I must protect it. Sometimes, it can put a lot of pressure on you. Sometimes, you just want to relax and be like, 'I don't have to keep worrying about everything and everybody all the time and I can just maybe be vulnerable and let somebody else protect me'.\" He further added, \"Why can't we flip roles sometimes? You can feel like that and its fair to feel like that because eventually everybody is human. We feel all kind of emotions. A lot of men find it difficult to express their vulnerable side and I think because I am an actor, maybe I am comfortable because its a part of what I do. I have to be able to get to that place which is vulnerable and expressive. When you are an actor, you also understand that vulnerability is extremely attractive. Aggression cannot attract people the way vulnerability does. Its only human to be vulnerable, so as a man you should be okay with it.\" On the work front, Shahid Kapoor will next be seen in Deva, which will release in theatres on February 14, 2025. He will also be collaborating with Triptii Dimri for an upcoming film by Vishal Bhardwaj.",

    "description": "The 27-year-old Karan Aujla on ruling the charts, staying true to his roots, his Bollywood debut with the hit 'Tauba Tauba,' and why his upcoming India tour feels like homecoming.",
    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/KARAN-EYE-SCREEN-1600.jpg",
    "description1": "Almost four years ago, when Punjabi powerhouse Diljit Dosanjh wanted a song looking back at his two-decade career, he roped in Indo-Canadian Punjabi popstar and friend Karan Aujla to write for him. Precisely 10 minutes after the phone call, G.O.A.T (Greatest of All Time) came to life in Aujla’s Vancouver home in 2020 and became a banger at breakneck speed. A staple and one of the most-loved pieces at every Dosanjh concert that followed thereafter, including the famed Coachella and his Dil-luminati tour this year, it was also the finale piece at Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show in June. Aujla had dropped a coup d’etat of sorts. The vibe landed and the song came with a power punch — Dekh Bollywood vich jinne Khan ne/Ohna vich behnda sardaar, goriye (Look at all these Khans in Bollywood/This Sardar sits among them, my beautiful girl), was laden with imagery unheard of in the mainstream industry — of a Sikh entertainer being equated with Bollywood royalty, the Khans. Dosanjh was already breaking social and cultural stereotypes by being a global superstar who wore his dastaar (turban) and often a traditional folk outfit during his concerts; Aujla’s lines created a lyrical space where being a sardar, with all its symbols, was actually cool. “Many of us have always had an issue with the portrayal of Sikh characters in films, often caricaturised to suit directorial needs. Diljit has changed that. This line, this song by Karan Aujla succinctly portrays that,” says popular Punjabi singer Jassie Gill. Karan Aujla, in a conversation with SCREEN, says that while working with Diljit Dosanjh pushed him to elevate his own craft, songwriting feels instinctive to him and that he “avoids overthinking”. “When I sit down to write, I let emotions and ideas flow freely. My surroundings, personal experiences and the cultural background I come from all fuel my inspiration…Ultimately, I strive for authenticity in my lyrics. I want listeners to connect with the stories I tell through genuine emotions and relatable experiences. That connection is what makes my music resonate and I believe it’s the cornerstone of my songwriting process,” says Aujla. This year, he followed up G.O.A.T and an album titled Making Memories (2023) with his Bollywood debut – Tauba Tauba — an emphatic combination of breezy rhymes, a cheerful flute and a full piano melody paired with Punjabi lines raving about a stunner in the throaty Malwai dialect. Tauba Tauba, a song he wrote, composed and sang, from an otherwise lost cause of a film (Bad Newz, 2024), turned out to be one of this year’s biggest hits from Bollywood, which has been banking on remixes to survive. Aujla says he intentionally kept the lyrics simple. “Hindi really isn’t me. I wanted to familiarise a lot more people with Punjabi,” says Aujla. Authentic Punjabi lines with a contemporary, rakish energy was just the edge Aujla needed to get the song to ring up the charts. If Tauba Tauba offered Karan Aujla phenomenal success, two Junos (considered the Canadian Grammys) earlier this year from the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences for his song Softly, 2023 (which goes by the line Chunni meri rang de lalaariya), announced the arrival of a rare talent. While one was for being the ‘Breakthrough Artist of the Year’, the other was the Audience Choice Award, which has previously gone to the likes of Avril Lavigne, Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes, among others. It also marked another first — it made Aujla the only Punjabi artiste to land a Juno. The award, he says, was “a reminder of staying true to my roots” and “pushing boundaries”. “This award celebrates the hard work and talent of countless artistes in our scene. It highlights the global appeal of Punjabi music and shows that Indian artistes are making their mark on the international stage… I hope this inspires more Punjabi artistes to pursue their dreams and showcase the richness of our culture to a wider audience,” says Aujla. Several Punjabi hits in a year, a quick turnaround time (from writing a song to its recording), writing for almost 23 Punjabi artistes besides creating his own singing career, and collaborations with rappers Badshah and DIVINE, have put Aujla on a global map. “At this point, I am going to call him the biggest artiste in the Indian subcontinent. Karan is a brilliant performer, who is futuristic in his approach. Punjabi music is now changing every four months. He figures out what will work and executes it very quickly,” says Satvinder Singh Kohli, managing director, Speed Records Private Ltd, the biggest Punjabi music label in India. Gill believes that Aujla has become so free with his art now “that he is experimenting wonderfully and the results are brilliant”. Kohli, who is a Dosanjh acolyte himself, says that while the former is a global superstar and a brilliant performer, he is not writing and composing his songs. “Karan is first a lyricist and composer and then a singer,” says Kohli, who adds that most of Aujla’s audience comes from the Gen Z space. “His is a relatively younger audience. Those born after 1998 are listening to him and how,” says Kohli. &nbsp; View this post on Instagram &nbsp; A post shared by Karan Aujla (@karanaujla) This month, Karan Aujla begins his debut India tour, ‘It’s All A Dream’, tickets for which are selling out fast, and priced as high as Rs 15 lakh. “This tour means a lot more than just performing; it’s about connecting with my fans on a deeper level and sharing my music in the country that shaped me as an artiste. While my recent tours in the UK, Australia, and Canada were amazing, India hits different because it’s a homecoming of sorts,” says Aujla, who will be touring Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Jaipur, among other cities. Some stories aren’t meant to be. Even Aujla hasn’t been able to fathom how a 14-year-old from an agricultural family in Ghurala, a speck of a village in Punjab — who had lost both his parents as a young boy and had turned to writing as a refuge and worked as a longshoreman — became a pop star only a few years later. “Sometimes I can’t believe I am that same kid who lost his parents in India, made his way out to Canada… If you are dreaming, make sure you dream big,” said Aujla, in his acceptance speech at the Junos, remembering the toughest phase of his life. The youngest of three siblings, Karan grew up as Jaskaran Aujla. He lost his father to a motorcycle accident when he was just nine and his mother to gallbladder cancer five years later. Brought up by the family of his father’s younger brother, writing songs, he says, was the only real expression for him. While some of this poetry was melancholic, so",
    "description2": "me others carried a sense of hope. “Writing was a way for me to process my emotions during that challenging time. I wrote about loss, heartache and longing. It felt like a cathartic experience that laid the foundation for my musical journey, helping me find my voice and connect with others. I didn’t know how to talk about it to anybody, but I slowly realised I could turn songwriting into a hobby and then a profession,” says Aujla, Aujla was in class IX when his first song, Cell Phone, with singer Mac Benipal, whom he met at a wedding, was released on YouTube. The song, which spoke about feeling lost and alone amidst grinding poverty, tanked. “That song happened when I was 15. Looking back, every struggle taught me something valuable. It was those hard times that shaped my identity,” says Aujla. It was on a visit to Chandigarh with Benipal that Aujla discovered luxury SUVs, especially the Range Rover, and became fascinated with it. He eulogised the car and wrote Range, a song based on the rhyme and meter of Cell Phone, but this time describing the feeling of owning the luxury car. Gill, whom Aujla met when he was 14, was then an upcoming singer from the neighbouring village of Jandali. With a few hit songs in tow, he was already doing shows in Punjab. Aujla found out that Gill frequented his friend’s salon in Khanna, met him and offered him the lyrics of Range. “It was surprising that it had come from such a young boy. There were some very intricate things and rhythmically the song landed perfectly,” says Gill. The song became Aujla’s calling card to approach other producers. During those early writing years, he also started looking up online tutorials and interacting with established producers whilst experimenting with different styles. “I draw inspiration from both traditional Punjabi poetry and contemporary music,” says Aujla, who was always drawn to the work of Kuldeep Manak and Gurdas Mann. Range (Replay, Speed Records) came out in 2014 and was an instant hit. But by that time, Aujla had already immigrated to Canada to live with his sisters. “He was really young then and wanted to be featured in the music videos, but the new boys weren’t keen to give him a chance then,” says Kohli. The move to Canada from Ghurala in his early teens was a significant transition. “It was a mix of anxiety and nervousness…with a different culture, lifestyle and way of life,” says Aujla, who also figured that this was the space where he could express himself more freely. He found himself amid a multi-cultural setting that broadened his horizons. “It was inspiring to see how diverse communities came together and celebrated their heritage. This experience fuelled my creativity and encouraged me to explore new sounds and influences in my music. Over time, I began to find my place, build friendships, and embrace the opportunities. It became a pivotal chapter in my life, shaping both my identity and my musical journey,” says Aujla, who after high school took up a part-time job as a longshoreman in Surrey, British Columbia. As he loaded and unloaded cargo on the docks and learned the value of hard work, deep down he knew it was a temporary phase. “During those long hours, I would daydream about my music and the impact I wanted to make. It was a tough environment, but it motivated me to push harder for my dreams. That experience reinforced my belief in pursuing my passion. It reminded me that every struggle can lead to growth, and ultimately, I knew I was meant to share my stories through music. It was all part of the journey to get where I am today,” says Aujla. He soon met Punjabi composers and producers Deep Jandu and Elly Mangat and began writing lyrics for them. This also led him to write for Jazzy B and Bohemia, two big names in the circuit. His song Blessings of Bapu (2015) sung by Gagan Kokri found some attention back home. But Aujla wasn’t still a familiar name because he wasn’t the face of the songs. Also, the concept of credit for the lyricist was a bit muddled. What changed the game for him was a song called Don’t Worry (2018) featuring Punjabi singer Gurlez Akhtar, which captured his personality, helping him connect with the fans. “I was still navigating my way through the music industry. The song captured the essence of facing life’s challenges with a positive outlook, which resonated deeply with many people,” says Aujla. He didn’t look back from here, releasing one song after another, most of them blending hip-hop with a typical Punjabi sound identity. The audience was lapping it up and asking for more. In the last few decades, Punjab’s cultural identity has seen a big transformation. Shrinking agriculture prospects, lack of jobs and industry have led motifs in older songs that spoke of births, weddings and military life and rich Punjabi literature, to be replaced by lyrics dominated by guns, drugs and misogyny, among others. The loss of innocence and its replacement by a certain aggressive culture in Punjabi songs has been a prominent cultural shift, buoyed by the Internet. Aujla’s rivalry with slain singer Siddhu Moosewala was also a consequence of being in the same gun-toting, sabre-rattling space. The two started off as friends, but conversation leaks led to both sides dissing each other through their songs. Aujla blames “the pressures of fame, expectations from fans, and the aggressive nature of the industry” for the conflicts and misunderstandings. “It is a reminder of how fragile relationships can be in this industry and how important it is to communicate openly and respectfully. I hope that artistes can learn from such situations and focus on creating music that brings people together rather than allowing conflicts to divide us. It’s crucial to prioritise our artistry and the message we want to convey, while also remembering the importance of unity within the music community,” says Aujla. A couple of years before Moosewala’s death, Karan Aujla was also asked by Chandigarh police to refrain from songs glorifying violence and drugs. He agreed to make the change. “As an artiste with a large following, I recognise my responsibility. I’ve become more mindful about my lyrical choices and believe in striking a balance between hard and soft tracks. It’s about creating a body of work that is both relatable and responsible. My music will maintain that balance while evolving with the changing industry landscape,” says Aujla, who is all set for a new, big release with Dosanjh besides the upcoming tour. “This tour is not just about performing; it’s about celebrating our culture, Punjabi music and sharing it in the country that shaped me as an artiste,” he says.",

According to trade website Sacnilk, the advance bookings for Pushpa 2: The Rule is growing from strength to strength, and the film has already collected Rs 30.92 crore for Day 1. With three more days left for the release, and Allu Arjun and team Pushpa amping up the promotions, the numbers might just surprise everyone.  ALSO READ: Allu Arjun’s Pushpa 2 The Rule on the way to blockbuster opening, Telangana government clears decks Almost 7 lakh tickets have been sold across all the languages and formats Pushpa 2: The Rule is being released. The film will be out in 2D, 3D, IMAX, and 4DX. As expected, it is the Telugu numbers that have reached dizzying heights, but what has been really interesting is the numbers of the Hindi version not lagging behind by much. For instance, the advance booking numbers for the Telugu versions of Pushpa 2 has amounted to Rs 10.57 crore, and the Hindi numbers amount to Rs 10.14 crore. Even on the number of tickets sold, the Hindi version has 3,40,892 while the Telugu version is at 2,73,519. This is something unprecedented in recent Indian cinema history. While the Telugu 2D version has outperformed every other language, it is all about the Hindi version in the 3D and IMAX formats. Incidentally, the opening weekend collection of the Hindi version of Pushpa 1 was around Rs 13 crore, and Pushpa 2 would comfortably sail past this number on Day 1. The Malayalam version of Pushpa 2 is also doing considerably well, but the Tamil and Kannada versions are picking up slowly.

Interestingly, Kalki 2989 AD, the highest-grossing film of the year, made Rs 61 crores in advance booking for Day 1. It went on to make Rs 95.3 on Day 1 of its release, and it would be interesting to see if Pushpa 2: The Rule breaches the Rs 100 crore mark domestically on Day 1. The fact that there are paid premieres on December 4 where the Telangana government has allowed a price hike might just facilitate a massive opening for the film.  Pushpa 2 Cast and Crew With Allu Arjun playing the titular role, Pushpa 2: The Rule will see the return of Rashmika Mandanna, Fahadh Faasil, Rao Ramesh, Sunil, Ajay Ghosh, Dhananjaya, and Prathap Bhandari who would be reprising their roles from the first instalment.  Despite a public tiff with the makers regarding the issue of delay in scoring the background music, Devi Sri Prasad has delivered a chartbuster album once again. The latest song, Peelings, has attained viral popularity within hours of its release.

    "description1": "Priyanka Chopra's mother, Dr Madhu Chopra, has never shied away from talking about her daughter, career, and the past challenges that they had to overcome as a family. Priyanka, who won Miss India title in the year 2000 and was later crowned Miss World, had to go through a lot of hardships to achieve her goal. In a recent interview on the Something Bigger Show, Madhu revealed that she had to quit her medical practice for PeeCee's career because of her husband's patriarchal family. Recalling the difficult period of convincing her husband, late Ashok Chopra, to send Priyanka to Mumbai for Miss India, she shared, \"Priyanka was studying in 12th standard and was about to give her board exams, so telling her dad and convincing him to say yes during her gap year was another task. Both the kids came and kept asking him. He said, 'Boards are not easy, let her study, don't bring in all these distractions'. After that, children were disappointed so they went downstairs to their bedroom.\" Madhu continued, \"Then I asked him, 'How many people in this country get this opportunity?' She is in the gap year and this is an opportunity that has come out of nowhere. Its just a matter of a week max. So, he said okay. And then she won, one after the other, then she also got selected for Miss India.\" ALSO READ | Priyanka Chopra wept as she reluctantly signe",

We went to his place and told him everything, then I told him that she has to go to Bombay for the training. He was absolutely against it. He said, 'You people are putting ideas into your child's head. Girls from our family don't do this'. We heard a lot, Priyanka cried a lot. She thought bade papa would melt but he said no. Then, I spoke to his wife and said, 'Again the same thing. Its an opportunity, its not like she is going away from home. If she makes it, fine, if she doesn't, she goes back to school. There is no pressure on her'.\" \"Next morning, he sat me down and said that she can go but you have to forget your medical practice and you will be there with her every minute. You will go to Bombay with her, I said okay and promised. My husband also said that I will work for the two of us, I will take care of the practice,\" Madhu added. Eventually, her mum became her travelling partner. \"I was with her for 5-6 years after winning. I used to travel with her everywhere, every shoot, even in Bombay or anywhere in India. Then I stopped going to India shoots, I would only travel abroad with her,\" she said.",

    "description1": "Bandish Bandits, a series that became a fan favourite upon its release during the Covid-19 pandemic, is all set to return with an all-new season. Starring Ritwik Bhowmik and Shreya Chaudhary in lead roles, the trailer for Season 2 has been unveiled, promising a mix of drama, music, and rivalry. At the conclusion of Season 1, Radhe (Ritwik Bhowmik) achieved the title of Sangeet Samrat, while Tamanna (Shreya Chaudhary) began her journey to refine her artistic skills. The Season 2 trailer reveals a gripping storyline where Radhe and Tamanna cross paths again at the prestigious Euro Band Championship, one of the world’s biggest music competitions. Tamanna joins a renowned music school, where Divya Dutta plays her mentor, guiding her toward her aspirations. Meanwhile, Radhe grapples with preserving his musical heritage following the demise of his grandfather, Pandit Ji (Naseeruddin Shah). Despite their different goals, Radhe and Tamanna decide to compete in the championship. However, their growing ambitions and unresolved conflicts bring new challenges, turning their journey into a tense rivalry. ",
    "description2": "Talking about reprising his role, Ritwik Bhowmik shared, “For me, stepping into the shoes of Radhe is like coming home after a long day. It is a character I am grateful to have played for several reasons, most importantly, how much it has taught me as an actor and a person.\" \"Stepping back into Tamanna’s world for the upcoming season of Bandish Bandits feels like reconnecting with an old friend. She has grown, matured in ways I didn’t anticipate. Tamanna goes through so much in her life, and it’s been thrilling to convey the depth of her emotions—pain, love, anger, resentment—all shaped by the situations she faces.” said Shreya Chaudhry. The series also features Sheeba Chaddha, Atul Kulkarni, Rajesh Tailang, and Kunaal Roy Kapur, alongside new cast members Divya Dutta, Rohan Gurbaxani, Yashaswini Dayama, Aaliyah Qureshi, and Saurabh Nayyar.

The actor, who made his Bollywood debut with Vikramaditya Motwane's Lootera, had opened up about his career and relationship with money, in an interview earlier this year. In a video on Unfiltered by Samdish, Vikrant revealed he left TV even though he was being paid ₹35 lakh a month, to enter the film industry. The actor had started by narrating the story of how he was treated when his friends saw where he lived. He said, \"I once called some of my closest friends home in college. My mom cooks really well, so I called everyone home to eat. But when they saw my home, the plastic chairs, chipping paint, leaky ceiling, how the kitchen isn’t aesthetically clean, their behaviour changed… They left within an hour of coming to my home.

After I bought the home, paid off debts, gave my parents a better life, I still couldn’t sleep peacefully. I quit at that stage because good work felt more important. All my savings were exhausted and Sheetal (his wife) would lend me money to attend auditions,\" he said. Meanwhile, Vikrant Massey announced his retirement from acting at the prime of his professional life, leaving everyone shocked. After being praised for his performances in 12th Fail and Sector 36, he was last seen in The Sabarmati Report, based on the 2002 Godhra train burning incident in Gujarat, which is still running in theatres. Directed by Dheeraj Sarna, the film also stars Raashii Khanna and Riddhi Dogra in pivotal roles. According to Sacnilk, the film has earned ₹28.25 crore at the domestic box office, in its 17-day run so far.",

    "description1": "\n\n\nKolkata (West Bengal) [India], December 2 (ANI): Business consultant Suhel Seth, on Monday said that US President Joe Biden's unconditional pardon to his son Hunter Biden was a travesty of the US Justice system. He also called out the US justice system on the way they had handled Adani case.\nSeth, in conversation with ANI said that Biden had himself said that the US justice system was infected with politics and questioned if anyone would believe in the system.\n\n\"Yesterday, Joe Biden's unconditional pardon to his son Hunter Biden, to my mind is a travesty of the American justice system. What's worse is that it's an indictment of the justice system itself. A sitting president of the United States, Joe Biden, in this case, in his statement, has said that while he had faith in the American judiciary, he believes that politics has infected the American judiciary and therefore has led to a miscarriage of justice. These are not my words. These are the words of Joe Biden. If a sitting president of America says this about his justice system, you tell me who and where and why should anyone trust this American justice system?\" Seth said.\nSeth told ANI that the US Department of Justice is messed up and had taken a U-turn with Donald Trump.\n\"The Department of Justice is weaponized in the United States. We saw what happened with Donald Trump. Now you tell me, the same judge who indicted Donald Trump has now withdrawn the case. So it is an unholy mess,\" he said.\n\n\nSeth told ANI that he believed that action of US proescutors linking Gautam Adani to an alleged bribery case was because of the success India has achieved recently.\n\"What have we seen with Adanis? They are a group in India. They're operating again, under Indian regulatory systems, which are, to my mind, the best in the world or on par. What do they first say? They issue a press statement. That one particular Adani, another particular Adani have been named. Then they issue a statement. No, their names are not there. It is clearly a politicization and to my mind it's a politicization because of the success that Indians and Indian businesses have achieved. This is a play of po",
    "description2": "litical purpose. It is not a play of justice. It's not a play of equality. You know, Amartya Sen very famously in a book called The Idea of Justice says, and he says it brilliantly, he says ultimately justice is about fairness,\" he said.\nSeth said that if the outgoing US President felt that the justice department was unfair to his son, how could it be fair with Adani, or several Indians indicted in US?\n\"If the American president thinks it's unfair for his son, how can it be fair on any Indian company? Be it Adani, be it anyone. Several Indians individually have been indicted in the United States. See what happened with the famous Goldman Sachs Rajat Gupta case. So I'm telling you that today, people in India who are also the so-called woke, liberal, pseudo-liberal people should realize that the people they had hope in have actually bolted from the stables. The sitting American president on December 1 not only pardons his son, so let's not even talk about nepotism, but issues the worst indictment of the American justice system. Nothing can be more ironic. Nothing can be more telling and nothing can be more disastrous. So the Americans must recognize that they are actually in a banana republic with a kingdom which is falling apart, especially when they believe that justice is one of their important pillars of hope,\" he said.\nUS President Joe Biden on Sunday signed a pardon for his son, Robert Hunter Biden, who had been convicted on charges related to gun crimes and tax violations. The pardon ensures that Hunter Biden will not face sentencing for these offences and removes the possibility of prison time.\nIn a statement, President Biden addressed the charges against his son, arguing that individuals in similar situations--such as those with tax payment issues due to addiction--typically receive non-criminal resolutions. He contended that Hunter's case was treated differently, leading to felony charges despite the absence of aggravating factors.\nBiden also stressed his commitment to not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, despite his belief that his son had been \"selectively and unfairly prosecuted.\" (ANI)\n",

It is renowned for being rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), particularly oleic acid, which is known to lower bad cholesterol (LDL) levels while maintaining or even boosting good cholesterol (HDL). Olive oil also contains powerful antioxidants like polyphenols and vitamin E, which help reduce inflammation, a critical factor in heart disease.Olive oil linked to low amounts of bad cholesterol in bloodResearchers from the University of Florida found that following a extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) diet resulted in lowered amounts of ‘bad’ cholesterol in the bloodstream.

It has a distinctive pungent flavor and is rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, as well as omega-6 fatty acids. These essential fatty acids are vital for reducing triglycerides and preventing blood clots, which can lower the risk of heart disease. Mustard oil also contains natural antioxidants and exhibits anti-inflammatory properties.Another notable feature of mustard oil is its high smoke point, making it suitable for high-temperature cooking methods like frying, which are prevalent in Indian cuisine. However, mustard oil contains erucic acid, which, in excessive amounts, has been debated for its potential adverse health effects. The presence of erucic acid in mustard oil has raised concerns regarding its cardiovascular safety, prompting regulatory scrutiny and public debate.Which one of these oils is heart-friendly?The best source for those seeking better heart health benefits is olive oil. It is suitable for low heat, cooking as it can be used for dressings and dips or even as a simple addition to a Mediterranean-style diet. Meanwhile, mustard oil holds cultural relevance and practicality for households in India as it has a high smoke point and is suitable for Indian cooking. It affords unique benefits, particularly to those who consume traditional Indian diets.ReplyForward",

    "description1": "Caring for a child is only one aspect of parenting; another involves creating deep emotional bonds and guiding them in developing into kind, self-assured adults. Parents may build a stronger relationship with their children, have meaningful conversations, and gain insight into their inner world by asking them meaningful questions every day. Here are six unique and powerful questions every parent should ask their child daily to foster emotional intelligence and mutual understanding. What is one kind thing you did for someone today?Teaching kindness starts with recognizing and celebrating small acts of generosity. By asking this query, parents inspire the kids to consider their behaviour and discover satisfaction in lending a hand to others. Also, it could inspire individuals to practise compassion more consistently. What is something new you discovered or found interesting today?Children spend their days studying and exploring because they are naturally curious. Whether it's an interesting fact they discovered in school, an original thought they had, or something they noticed, this question invites kids to share their experiences. It keeps you active in their intellectual development and develops their love of learning.  115837872Did anything puzzle you or make you feel ",
    "description2": "sad today?Creating a safe space for your child to express their struggles is crucial. This question allows them to open up about things that bothered them during the day, whether it's a tough moment with friends or a challenge they faced. Listening attentively can help them feel supported and teach them how to process difficult emotions. What was the most exciting or happiest moment of your day?Highlighting positive experiences helps your child focus on the good things in life. Whether it’s a fun activity, an achievement, or a moment of laughter, this question reinforces gratitude and gives you an insight into what makes your child happy.  115837847What made you laugh or smile today?Laughter is a window into a child’s heart. By asking this, you not only encourage your child to relive joyful moments but also show interest in what they find amusing. It’s a great way to bring a touch of positivity and lightness to your conversation. If you could change one thing about today, what would it be?The child can use this question to critically evaluate their day and consider areas for growth. It helps them develop their problem-solving abilities and gives them the confidence to face the following day with initiative. It also helps parents understand their goals or disappointments.",

    "description1": " No matter how stressful your corporate day job is, or how much your business makes you want to scratch your forehead during dire hours – parenting, many believe, is the trickiest of them all! The job that’s somewhat based on instincts, your intuitions, and gut feelings, and is largely about double, sometimes triple checking every single decision you make about your kid – is bound to take a toll on parents sometimes. However, the key to ace parenting, is to keep calm and carry one while you unlearn and learn!What is parenting?Parenting is the process of nurturing, protecting, and guiding a child from infancy to adulthood. It involves supporting a child's physical, cognitive, social, emotional, and educational development. Parenting can also refer to the care of a child by a caregiver or guardian, not just a biological parent.What is lighthouse parenting?Economist and parenting author Emily Oster, on a recent broadcast of ‘CBS Mornings Plus’, described a specific parenting style, called ‘lighthouse parenting’. She said, while urging the parents, “You’re the lighthouse. You’re guiding them, you’re showing them where the rocks are, but you’re giving them some independence. And it’s something between, you’re driving the boat for them, which is too involved, or you’re just letting them crash into the rocks, which is not recommended.”Psychologist Cara Damiano Goodwin explained to HuffPost, that, a parent who is acting like a lighthouse “points out the dangers in their children’s environments but ultimately lets their child steer their own boat.”As per Goodwin, examples of this parenting style include “giving your child strategies for remembering their homework, but not bringing it to school for them if they forget,” and “allowing them to figure out a compromise with their sibling on their own, rather than serving as a referee for sibling fights.” 115815324Dr. Ken Ginsburg, the founder and program director of the Center for Parent and Teen Communication and a professor of pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told HuffPost, “The term ‘lighthouse parenting’ is a metaphor to explain what we know works. What young people need, is both to be guided and for us to have appropriate boundaries to keep them safe.” Talking more the “reliable” style of parenting, he added, “We should trust that kids are going to learn to navigate the world on their own, but at the same time, we have to protect them.”Does li",
    "description2": "ghthouse parenting help raise confident kids?While all kids need both guidance and autonomy, teens in particular are eager to navigate the world on their own. Lighthouse parenting describes a way for parents to remain an influential presence in teens’ lives without hindering the independence we want them to achieve.As per Goodwin, “We need to show them that we have confidence and trust in them so that they can develop self-confidence. They also need to be allowed the chance to fail and make mistakes while they are still somewhat supported by their parents. Otherwise, they may fall apart when they fail for the first time as an adult out on their own.”For example, If your kid doesn’t finish their homework, instead of doing it for them (or hounding them endlessly about it), you, as a parent, might stand back, allowing them to experience the consequences of missing an assignment — which could motivate them to behave differently next time.As per Ginsburg, teens want to know that they are loved. At the same time, “they don’t want people to demand or to dictate,” he said. “They want guides.”Key points of lighthouse parenting: While lighthouse parenting is not a \"one size fits all\" approach, many children benefit from the parenting style depending on their needs and environment. The key points about the lighthouse parenting are:Balancing guidance and boundaries: Lighthouse parents provide guidance and set boundaries, while also allowing children to learn from their mistakes and navigate their own experiences. 115815381Encouraging independence: Lighthouse parents trust their children to make good decisions and follow the rules, which encourages independence.Providing emotional support: Lighthouse parents offer consistent emotional support while encouraging children to face challenges and solve their own problems.Celebrating successes: Lighthouse parents acknowledge and celebrate their children's achievements, which can boost their self-esteem and motivation.Helping children learn from failures: Lighthouse parents help children learn from their mistakes, which can help them develop a growth mindset.Building a relationship: Lighthouse parenting can help build a relationship between parent and child.Some benefits of lighthouse parenting include: Healthy boundaries, Developing coping skills, Learning essential life skills like confidence and independence, and Gaining the courage to confront obstacles head-on. 102164741",

    "description1": "When we think about mastering a new skill— whether it’s playing a musical instrument, learning a language, or perfecting a dance move—most of us focus on repetition. Practice makes one perfect, right? Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman sheds light on something even more fascinating: the power of pauses in supercharging our learning process.  The secret in the pause Recent research highlights that brief pauses during practice are far more than just breaks— they’re integral to the learning process. Gap effects research has identified that resting for just 10 seconds while practising a skill allows your brain to replay and reinforce what you’ve just learned  Here’s the astonishing part: During these short pauses, your brain doesn’t just sit idle. Instead, it replays the skill you’ve been practising at lightning speed— 20 to 30 times faster than normal— and often in reverse. It’s like your brain is rewinding and reviewing your actions to strengthen the connections needed to perform them better.  Practicing without practising Imagine you’re learning a new piano piece or perfecting your tennis serve. After a few repetitions, you stop for a quick break. During this pause, your brain's neurons fire rapidly, mimicking the action you were practising. This neural replay reinforces the skill, essentially letting you practice without actively moving. Neural recordings show that during these rest periods, your brain becomes highly active, refining your skills and improving your ",
    "description2": "learning, so your next attempt is even stronger.  Why does this work? The replay and consolidation of the information by the brain during rest is the basic concept through which we learn. When we repeat a skill without pausing, our neurons may not have enough time to process and solidify the information but once breaks are introduced, there is a chance for the rearrangement and strengthening of those neural pathways related to a particular skill.  It’s like building a strong foundation: practising creates the bricks, but pausing allows your brain to cement them into place.  How to use this insight - If you’re working on mastering something new, here’s how to apply this brain hack: - Practice in small chunks: Focus on the skill for a few minutes. - Take short breaks: Pause for 10 to 15 seconds of complete rest. Let your brain do its work. - Repeat: Alternate between practice and rest. This works for anything, from studying to actual sports, helping you progress faster while reducing fatigue. The big picture The insight of how the brain learns changes our approach to the skill-building process and practice. The discovery reveals that sometimes the most important work is to do nothing. By allowing your brain to optimize its processes during short breaks, you’re not only learning smarter but also paving the way for long-term mastery.  So, the next time you’re practising, remember: pausing isn’t slacking— it’s part of the strategy.13700391115593148104441185115427749 ",

The podcast episode highlighted the fun and sometimes bumpy bond between Abhishek Bachchan and his sister, Shweta Bachchan. Shweta openly spoke about a hilarious incident from their childhood.Like many siblings, Abhishek and Shweta Bachchan enjoyed teasing each other. Shweta shared a funny story from their childhood when their parents were away for the night.

Even though it all started with a disagreement, this incident became a fond memory in their sibling bond.Shweta's mom, Jaya Bachchan, joined the talk, bringing some humor to the memory. She laughed as she told everyone that Abhishek cut Shweta's hair right down the middle of her head.115847756Apart from the haircut story, Shweta Bachchan also talked about some fun times from her childhood.
