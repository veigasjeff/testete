    "description1": "Pushpa 2 The Rule movie release live updates: Three years back when Pushpa 1 hit the screens, not many could predict the kind of impact it would have on Indian cinema. The film about the rise of a gutsy nobody to the top echelons of a smuggling syndicate found resonance across the country. Among its many box-office achievements, Pushpa also made history by making Allu Arjun the first male Telugu actor to receive a National Award for Best Actor. In fact, in an interview on Nandamuri Balakrishna’s Unstoppable with NBK, Allu Arjun spoke about how it was very distressing to not see a single male Telugu actor’s name in the Best Actor list, and Pushpa’s role in making history. Finally, the journey that started in December 2021 will come full circle this December as Pushpa 2: The Rule is set to hit theatres on Thursday.  Despite various controversies surrounding Pushpa 2, including a purported tiff between director Sukumar and Allu Arjun, and a public spat between composer Devi Sri Prasad and producers Mythri Movie Makers, the film has been completed, and is gearing up for a blockbuster opening. Major credit to the hype surrounding the film has to go to the in",

Since then, both these top-tier talents have been putting all their efforts to ensure Pushpa is a film that Indian cinema can be proud of. And in a few hours, we’d know if their vision comes true.",

    "description1": "The digital era has simplified a lot of things. Cinema watching isn’t exactly a chore now even if some of the films might make one feel so. You don’t have to walk to the nearby theatre in the hope that your favourite film has tickets to spare. Everything happens in a few clicks and an OTP. Recently, I decided to go old-school and walk to the theatre and book a ticket directly. A middle-aged woman in her 50s walked up to the same ticketing counter asking if a particular film was running in the theatre. When they replied in the negative, she pulled out a newspaper listing and said the ad said otherwise. Now, this helped in recalibrating the urban audience’s belief that accessibility to cinema is at everyone’s fingertips. When you look at the returns of any big-ticket film, it is clear that the non-urban audience maketh the numbers. However, many times this loyal demographic is forgotten to cater to an audience that is seemingly growing distant from the kind of popcorn entertainment every industry dishes out with mind-boggling consistency. Probably why Allu Arjun, team Pushpa 2: The Rule, and Telugu cinema are changing the game. ALSO READ: Pushpa 2 advance booking: Allu Arjun film sells almost 12 lakh tickets; trumps Baahubali, KGF 2 and RRR to sell fastest 1 million tickets Manoj Bajpayee once said that the reason for the success of films like KGF and Pushpa is because the audience are searching for heroes that would tell them all is well, and winning in life will happen even for the ones who have hit rock bottom. This level of aspiration was seen in 1970s and 1980s Indian cinema where the heroes were catering to the masses, who are often overlooked as people whose tastes aren’t ‘refined’ enough. However, that was never the case in South cinema where the biggest of stars redefined the term ‘mass’ and made films that catered to everyone. Even when the characters did unimaginable things that defied all known laws of science, it was still a common man doing it. But there was a chasm between these believers, and their matinee idols. At the turn of the 2010s, Hindi cinema understood the need to bridge this chasm, but the stars continued to remain inaccessible. Yes, they were there on the billboards, the advertisements, the social media campaigns, and of course, on the big screen. But the ‘opportunity’ to see them in flesh and blood was becoming rare for the non-urban audience.  Here's the Pushpa 2 Trailer: Tamil filmmaker Hari, the brain behind films like Singam and Saamy, went to the theatres of Tamil Nadu to promote his film, Yaanai. When asked about the reason behind his action, Hari said, “It is important we let the patrons of the theatre know that our films are reaching them. It is important we respect them as an important stakeholder and urge them to come see our films.” This is an important angle to the debate about watching films in theatres vs watching films on OTT. Of course, it can be argued that the makers make money anyway, and why should the OTT watchers be shamed for watching the films legally on a paid subscription. But before all that, there comes the issue of stars appeasing their audience and not alienating them.  This is probably why South cinema, especially Telugu films, which ignited the pan-Indian cinema of today, continues to reap rich benefits from this phenomenon. Even though recent blockbusters of Hindi cinema made a lot of money all across the country, it was for their original Hindi versions. Almost every star didn't consider all markets as equally important. They might have appeared on podcasts, social media reels, YouTube interviews, and even press interactions in select urban cities. But the returns are there for everyone to see. On the contrary, look at what is happening with the likes of Kalki 2898 AD, Devara Part-1, and the upcoming juggernaut, Pushpa 2.  Pushpa 2: The Rule’s most-recent event happened in Hyderabad with just two days left for the release. But where did they start their promotional campaign? It was in Patna, Bihar. Why should a Telugu film’s trailer be launched in Patna? But seeing the crowd that turned up would have been a massive shot-in-the-arm for whoever devised this strategy. It was a masterstroke. Just a week or so before that Ram Charan and team Game Changer landed in Lucknow to launch the teaser of the Shankar film. The writing was clear on the wall. You want to be a pan-Indian hero, you have to go everywhere to promote your film. You must provide the audience an incentive to come watch your film. And what is that incentive? Respect. When stars descend to understand the ground reality, the support is massive. Allu Arjun was a bonafide superstar even before Sukum",
    "description2": "ar brought Pushpa into his life. But what he is today has been the dream of many a superstar before him. Many achieved it in varying degrees, but Allu Arjun has blazed an important trail. He is walking on a carefully curated path that suits him like a colourful shirt on the torso of Pushpa. Look at how he changed his demeanour and speeches at every leg of the Pushpa’s promotional drive. Well, Allu Arjun is definitely not the first one to go all guns blazing with pan-Indian promotions. Yes, Yash did something similar with his KGF films, but it is important he is back soon to stay in the national consciousness. He has the stardom, but not the cushion of an Arjun who is more than just Pushpa for his fans outside Telugu cinema. Then, we saw Ram Charan, Jr NTR, and SS Rajamouli do it for RRR. We saw Kamal Haasan do it for Vikram. We saw Suriya and team do it for Kanguva. However, most of them couldn't really bridge that gap with audiences of those regions. It wasn't enough to be there, it was important to connect with them. That is why Pushpa 2: The Rule is an important chapter of this changing ecosystem.   In Patna, Allu Arjun paraphrased the iconic “Jhukega nahi” line, and said he will indeed bow down to the love of the people of Bihar. In Kochi, he called himself ‘Mallu Arjun’ and spoke about how Kerala adopted him as their own, and gave rise to the term ‘Allu Arjun Army’. In Tamil Nadu, he called Chennai his home, and spoke about how he always wanted to do a massive function in the city to keep his connection strong with his home of 21 years. In Mumbai, he spoke about how he wanted to shave his beard off and hug his daughter. In Hyderabad, what transpired between an emotional Allu Arjun and Sukumar put to an end the chatter around their reported tiff. And in each of these events Rashmika Mandanna joined him to say just the right things to cater to each audience. She showcased her Hindi speaking skills, her fashion choices, her emotional side, and even touched upon her relationship status in these events. The makers also brought in Sreeleela for the last leg of the promotions that gave a big boost to the music of the film. It was also beautiful how these whirlwind promotions ensured the audience forgot the skirmishes between the producers and composer Devi Sri Prasad. What was beautiful was how Arjun danced with Rashmika only in Mumbai. What was beautiful was how Arjun danced on stage without being asked to in Chennai. Some might have been spontaneous, and some others might have been orchestrated like it was spontaneous. But make no mistake, everything was carefully planned, curated, and delivered like a boss!  It was almost like Allu Arjun, Rashmika and team Pushpa anticipated all the questions that might have been asked in individual interviews in each of these regions, and wrapped it all up in a nice bouquet and gave it to the audience. This move might not always work for every film and every actor, but it has definitely worked for Pushpa 2: The Rule and Allu Arjun. Without giving interviews to the media, be it on YouTube or newspapers, Pushpa 2: The Rule gave its audience an exclusivity that they don’t always get. The people who saw them talk and dance in person were the only ones who got to see it all LIVE. They were the first audience. Whatever got printed, circulated, written online, and shared as YouTube videos were secondary. Imagine that high for an audience who don’t always get to see these stars even this close.  ALSO READ: Making of Pushpa 2: BTS video reveals the true force behind this mass actioner isn’t Allu Arjun or Fahadh Faasil Of course, apart from Patna, even team Pushpa 2: The Rule only reached out to the big cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kochi, but in a world where stars are increasingly getting elusive, Allu Arjun and Co proved to the world that there is a path that circumvents the middlemen. A path that takes your film directly to the ones that matter the most… The people who would throng the theatres on the opening weekend even if the prices are jacked up. The people who would queue up on Day 1, burst crackers, light lamps, pour milk, and do everything in their power to celebrate their matinee idol. They might have done it anyway… but why would they put in their hearts and souls in it this time? Because they understand why Pushpa wants to prove to the world that he is not just a fire, but a wildfire… it is all about getting that respect. And when Allu Arjun told Patna that he would bow down to their love and adulation… it wasn’t a dialogue. It was a loud statement. A statement that would find many imitations soon, but that’s okay… because the brand will always belong to Pushpa.",

    "description1": "Actor Vivek Oberoi burst on the screen with films such as Company and Saathiya. Establishing himself as an actor who can play the boy-next-door and a dreaded gangster with the same ease, it appeared that the actor was here to stay, but in Bollywood, things can be ephemeral despite talent and hard work. The actor faced a dull phase despite his films working and had to sit at home for a long period of time. Vivek, however, had his Plan B in place all along. Twenty-two years later, Vivek is a successful entrepreneur running multiple businesses across industries, which he juggles with his film career. He lives in Dubai and keeps his passion for acting alive still. In an exclusive conversation with SCREEN, the actor revisits his journey, and his Chocolate Boy era, and also reveals how he had to switch to business to counter the efforts of a lobby that existed within the industry. &nbsp; View this post on Instagram &nbsp; A post shared by Vivek Oberoi (@vivekoberoi)  Also Read: Vivek Oberoi says he became a salesman at age 10 because of his father: ‘It could be electronics, perfumes; I would keep profits’ Talking about facing concerted efforts against him in Hindi film industry, Vivek shared, \"I have done about 67 projects in 22 years, but the industry is a very insecure place. You could be performing well, winning awards, and doing your job as an actor, but at the same time, you can get no work for other reasons. After 2007 when I did Shootout At Lokhandwala, the Ganpat song went viral, I won awards, so I expected a lot of offers, but I didn’t get any. I sat at home for 14 to 15 months after the success of the film. It was only around the 2009 mark when I decided I didn’t want to be completely dependent on this but build my economic independence. I didn’t want to be in a situation where a lobby could decide your future. Somebody could bully you into doing something because they controlled things.\" Sharing how venturing into business gave him the independence",
    "description2": " he always needed, Vivek also added, \"Business was always a Plan B, and I decided cinema will be my passion. My livelihood should be my business, which helped me earn my independence and get out of that whole trap of lobbies, or having to sell your soul or suck up to somebody that is no great way to live at least for me. Some people make a living out of it but for me, that’s not the case.\" &nbsp; View this post on Instagram &nbsp; A post shared by Vivek Oberoi (@vivekoberoi)  Currently, Vivek has three films in the pipeline and is promoting his firm Solatrio that sells lab-grown diamond jewelry. But sharing one lesson he has learned through his 22-year-long journey in Bollywood, the actor says, \"I was stressed about so many things, took so much tension, it was just not worth it. Life finds its way to sort it out, there is a karmic score - you do good, you will get that back; if you do bad, you will receive it too. Somebody may seem very successful and important, but inside he could be empty, sad, and lonely, that’s their score. Life is about choices, even today if you choose good, your life will start changing from tomorrow. It is we who don’t do things then we blame god and destiny. It's more like we have become human doings rather than human beings.\" He also added, \"I am at an age and stage in my life where money, fame, success, glory are something I have seen a lot. So it's not life-changing anymore.\" Sharing further updates on his professional front, Vivek said, \"On the business front, I am taking Solitario public early next year, I want to go global with it. On the film front, I have three movies signed up, the first one is Masti 4. I am having a lot of fun cracking up between me, Riteish, Aftaab, and Induji, Milap Zaveri is directing it. It's been 20 years since the first one, a lot of friends are coming together. We are shooting in March or April so I guess it should release in 2025. The other 2 are not announced yet but I am excited about them.\"",

    "description": "Senna review: Expensive-looking but shoddily written, Netflix's biographical drama about Ayrton Senna is among the streamer's most disappointing shows of the year. ",
    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/senna-review-netflix.jpg",
    "description1": "If nobody were to speak in the new Netflix show Senna, it would immediately warrant at least two extra stars. But each time any of its wafer-thin characters opens their mouths, you’re likely to be overcome by an intense desire to pump the breaks and make a pit stop, or perhaps rewatch Asif Kapadia’s seminal documentary on the subject. Based on the life and career of the legendary Brazilian Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, the six-part biographical drama is flat, uninteresting, and most criminally, boring. It is perhaps the least effective way in which his extraordinary career, and lasting influence, could’ve been commemorated. Starring Gabriel Leone, who, incidentally, has already played a slain race car driver once before — he appeared in a memorable supporting role in Michael Mann’s Ferrari — the show is undone by a kind of storytelling that can only be described as Kabir Khan-coded. Ayrton goes from buzzing around in imaginary race cars as a child to winning go-kart championships in the span of minutes; his talent is unquestionable, his passion is unmatched. He is virtually infallible; outsmarting, outmanoeuvring, and out-performing every rival who dares to create obstacles in his path. What a dull way to create drama. Also read - Sam Bahadur: Meghna Gulzar’s crash course on how not to make a biopic, a dramatic reenactment of a Vicky-pedia page With the unshakeable support of his parents, a teenage Ayrton is sent away to the United Kingdom, where he makes waves in the Formula Ford circuit and catches the attention of F1 ‘principals’. He is immediately hired by a team called Toleman, where he scores several podiums in his debut season. The storytelling in first couple of episodes isn’t economical, it’s indisciplined. The writers appear to be rushing through the beats, without bothering to linger on moments of emotional resonance. Not that there are too many to begin with. For instance, Ayrton’s childhood sweetheart is introduced and dispensed with in about half an hour. During this time, they get married and divorced. Forget examining the psychological impact that this had on Ayrton, the show appears to view this chapter in his life as little more than a speed bump. Netflix’s international programming has been thriving; there are enough examples of crossover hits to suggest that the streamer knows what it’s doing by letting local-language creators operate with relative freedom. But the writing in Senna is so juvenile that a simple interaction can often feel like watching two people from different countries conversing via Google Translate. Every character, including Aryton himself, speaks in exposition. “That bloody idiot’s going over 100 miles per hour on a track he doesn’t know!” one character declares during a dangerous race. \"You are the fastest driver in the history of Formula One,",
    "description2": "\" another character tells Ayrton to his face. Most hilariously, a woman that he hooks up with after his divorce gets out of bed, gazes into the distance, and says, “Down there, three out of three people think they’re royalty. To claim your place here, you have to act like a king.” There is a clap of thunder, and Ayrton replies, “I think it’s going to rain.” He doesn't mean it metaphorically. It’s painful to watch. And it doesn’t get any better as it goes along. If anything, show runner Vicente Amorim doubles down on this style as Ayrton’s personal life takes a back seat over his professional achievements. The racer’s fans would already be familiar with the highlights of his career, and the show checks off each event with a robotic diligence. We witness his exceptional driving skills during rainy weather in Portugal; we watch as he pushes his McLaren to the limits in Monaco; and we automatically take his side when a rivalry emerges between him and his teammate, Alain Prost. The Frenchman's sole purpose, it seems, is to silently glare at Ayrton at different settings, and then to complain about him to the chief of the FISA, Jean-Marie Balestre. These characters are entirely two-dimensional. Prost wants to defeat him on the track, Balestre wants to end his career off it. They do what they do because the show needs them to do it, not because they have any personal motivation to bring him down. There is shockingly little on the page here, and one wonders how something as by-the-numbers as this was green-lit in the first place. It would be unfair to blame the actors; even Daniel Day-Lewis would’ve struggled to polish this material. Leone was set up to fail. He delivers every line with the same earnest optimism, like a child begging their mother to be allowed an extra hour outside.

Heavily inspired by the stylised action in Ron Howard’s Rush, the races in Senna are nearly able rescue the show, but not quite. They’re dynamic, exciting, and unlike the rest of the series, easy to follow. The editing is melodic, the cinematography is evocative. You actually care about the outcome. It’s as if an entirely different team of filmmakers was responsible for the action, which swerves between practical and computer-generated with surprising smoothness. Had the drama around these sequences been even a fraction more engaging, Senna would’ve deserved a recommendation. But as it stands, it’s among the worst high-profile Netflix shows of the year.

In an interview, Vikrant clarified that he is simply taking a 'break' because he is 'burned out'. He also said that his health has taken a hit, although he didn't specify his ailment. He told News18, “I’m not retiring… Just burned out. Need a long break. Miss home and health is also acting up… People misread it.\" The actor's spokesperson also shared a statement where he said that he is taking a break because his health has \"taken a hit.\" He shared that he wants to improve his craft as he is feeling a \"sense of monotony at the moment.\" He insisted that his post has been \"misinterpreted.\" His statement read, \"Acting is all I can do. And it has given me everything I have. My physical and mental health have taken a hit. I just want to take some time off, want to better my craft. I feel a sense of monotony at the moment. My post has been misinterpreted. That I am quiting or retiring from acting. I want to take some time off to focus on my family and health.

On Monday evening, Vikrant attended a special screening of his film The Sabarmati Report with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, among others. He refused to take questions about his 'retirement'. In 2023, Vikrant delivered the biggest solo hit of his career, the acclaimed drama 12th Fail, directed by Vidhu Vinod Chopra. This month, a behind-the-scenes feature about the making of 12th Fail, titled Zero Se Restart, will be released in theatres. Vikrant broke out with roles on television before starring in films such as A Death in the Gunj and Lootera.",

    "description1": "Debbie Nelson, the single mother of rapper Eminem, whose rocky relationship with her son was known widely through his hit song lyrics, has died. She was 69. Eminem’s long-time representative, Dennis Dennehy, confirmed Nelson’s death in an email on Tuesday. He did not provide a cause of death, although Nelson had battled lung cancer. Nelson was born in 1955 on a military base in Kansas. Her fraught relationship with her son, whose real name is Marshall Mathers III, has been no secret since the Detroit rapper became a star. Eminem has disparaged his mother in songs such as the 2002 single “Cleaning Out My Closet.” Eminem sings: “Witnessin’ your mama poppin’ prescription pills in the kitchen. My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn’t.” In lyrics from his Oscar-winning hit “Lose Yourself” from the movie “8 Mile,” his feelings seem to have simmered, referencing his \"mom’s spaghetti.” The song went on to win best rap song at the 2004 Grammy Awards. Nelson brought and settled a pair of defamation lawsuits over Eminem’s statements about her in magazines and on radio talk shows",
    "description2": ". In her 2008 book, “My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem,” she attempted to set the record straight by providing readers details about the rapper’s early life, writing that Eminem had forgotten the good times they had. “Marshall and I were so close that friends and relatives commented that it was as if the umbilical cord had never been cut,” she wrote. She also detailed her own childhood, describing a violent home life in which her dad’s mother, who she spent summers with, was “the one woman in my large, dysfunctional family to show us kids love. ”In 2004, she was dragged from her car on Eight Mile Road, the street in a Detroit suburb made famous by “8 Mile,” by a 16-year-old who was later sentenced to more than four years in prison. She suffered bruises and a broken foot. The highly acclaimed rapper Eminem won for best hip hop act at the 2024 MTV EMAs and was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2022. He announced in October that he was going to be a grandfather, saying his daughter Hailie Jade is pregnant by way of a touching music video that is a tribute to their relationship.",

    "description1": "Though mainstream Indian cinema has been making waves across the globe with impressive box office numbers, the industry — comprising numerous regional segments — has yet to make a lasting impact at prestigious award events like the Oscars. However, the landscape is gradually evolving, with Indian films making significant inroads into the international festival circuit and earning accolades. A notable example is director Payal Kapadia’s All We Imagine As Light (AWIAL), which has garnered top honours at nearly every festival it has attended this year. Despite its success, AWIAL was passed over as India’s official entry for the Best International Feature Film category at the 97th Academy Awards in favour of Kiran Rao’s Laapataa Ladies. Although AWIAL brought home the Grand Prix — the second-highest award at the Cannes Film Festival after the Palme d’Or — its exclusion as India’s Oscar entry sparked widespread debate. Many pointed to power politics in the selection process, especially since Laapataa Ladies is co-produced by Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan. However, some have argued that Aamir’s involvement could be advantageous, as his star power might draw the attention of members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), who vote for the awards. Only in SCREEN | Vivek Oberoi says he became a businessman after facing Bollywood lobbies: ‘They can’t decide my future, my livelihood is…’ Strengthening this argument, a report has emerged that Aamir has joined forces with multiple Oscar-winning Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón for Laapataa Ladies' (released internationally as Lost Ladies) Academy Awards campaign. Cuarón, known for films like Y Tu Mamá También (2001), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Az",
    "description2": "kaban (2004), Children of Men (2006), Gravity (2013) and Roma (2018), and the series Disclaimer (2024), will host a special screening of the film in London. Notably, Cuarón’s Roma won the Best International Feature Film Oscar in 2018, the same category in which Laapataa Ladies now competes. This Oscar bid holds particular significance for Aamir Khan, whose Lagaan (2001) remains the most recent Indian film to receive a nomination in the Best Foreign Language Film category, following Mother India (1957) and Salaam Bombay! (1988). Reflecting on the campaign process, Aamir told Variety, \"Your effort is to get your film seen by them (members of the Academy), and their attention onto your film. And then once they see it, it’s really up to them. That’s what we did in Lagaan. That’s what we’re doing here.\" Check out | Inside Ananya Panday’s home: Chunky Panday says daughter ‘destroyed’ their home during parties, but is ‘particular’ about hers Cuarón is set to host a screening of Laapataa Ladies in London on December 5. \"It just shows that there are different filmmakers around the world who are willing to champion the film,\" Jyoti Deshpande of Jio Studios, who co-produced the movie with Aamir and director Kiran, said. \"India has done a lot for the global film industry, in terms of the number of films it makes, the number of languages we have, how rich in culture we are… I think India has come of age and deserves to win an Oscar.\" Meanwhile, the overlooked AWIAL continues its phenomenal run on the festival circuit, collecting more prestigious awards with each outing. Just recently it won the Best International at the New York Film Critics Circle and the Best International Feature trophy at the reputed Gotham Awards 2024.",

His pursuit of uncovering a massive scam turns into a perilous journey as unknown threats mount against him. The trailer hints at a thrilling tale of truth versus survival.\nThe story not only follows Bajpayee's character, Joy Bag, as he navigates a dangerous investigation but also explores his troubled marriage.\n\n\nActor Shahana Goswami, who plays Manoj Bajpayee's wife in the upcoming crime thriller Despatch, opened up about her role in the film in a conversation with ANI.\nWhile speaking about her character, the actress said, \"Dekhie kya hota hain na aise situations me ek kisi ka dor kaatna zaruri hojata hain kyuki dono taraf se jo ek pull and push hota ha",

Toh kahin ek pull and push rhta hain toh I think wo uske khudke zindagi, Shweta ke lie zaroori tha.\"\nDirector Kanu Behl, speaking about the inspiration for Despatch, said, \"In 2016, I started thinking about the world of crime journalism. Incidents like the ones involving Gauri Lankesh disturbed me deeply. As a father of a five-year-old, I wondered what kind of world we are leaving behind for the next generation. My son's name is Duniya (world), and somewhere, this thought triggered the story. I felt this was something that needed to be talked about.\"\nArrchita Agarwaal, who is also a part of the cast, shared her excitement about working with Bajpayee and director Behl. She said, \"I feel very lucky that Manoj sir is part of this film. He has so much experience, but he created a space for me where I felt comfortable. With Kanu sir's guidance, I only had to learn. I started from zero, and everything I gained from this film was an achievement.\"\nApart from Manoj Bajpayee in the lead role, the movie also features Shahana Goswami, Arrchita Agarwaal, and others in crucial roles.

ETimes rated the film 3 out of 5 and our review read, “After the reel-life portrayal of the war hero Vikram Batra in Shershaah, Sidharth returns as commando Arun Katyal in Yodha, showcasing his competence as an action hero. The movie majorly rests on his shoulders. Raashii Khanna pulls off the part of playing Arun's love interest with ease. Disha Patani plays a pivotal role as an air hostess caught amid the hostage drama. Tanuj Virwani, another commando of the special task force, makes his presence felt in his limited role. Sunny Hinduja pulls off his role with confidence. All said, Yodha’s action is thrilling, but it does not really take your imagination to the flight.”Sidharth will be next seen in the thriller ‘Vvan-Force’. ",

    "description1": "It's very rare to see Shahid Kapoor open up about his personal life. However, the actor has had his own fair share of ups and downs in his personal and professional life. In a recent conversation with Faye D'Souza on her Youtube channel, Shahid, who had a long term relationship with actor Kareena Kapoor Khan, got candid about 'crying' on sets, due to a 'heartbreak'. When asked if he has ever wept in a room alone because of his career, Shahid answered, \"That only happened to me when I went through heartbreak. And, sometimes it happens when you are making movies. So, I have had that. It was really bad. My makeup guy was like, 'I just finished your makeup! Can you just not?'\" The actor instantly started explaining his state while talking in a weeping tone, 'I can't help it, I think I am destroying myself'. \"I have been through those but not for work,\" he added.

Sometimes, it can put a lot of pressure on you. Sometimes, you just want to relax and be like, 'I don't have to keep worrying about everything and everybody all the time and I can just maybe be vulnerable and let somebody else protect me'.\" He further added, \"Why can't we flip roles sometimes? You can feel like that and its fair to feel like that because eventually everybody is human. We feel all kind of emotions. A lot of men find it difficult to express their vulnerable side and I think because I am an actor, maybe I am comfortable because its a part of what I do. I have to be able to get to that place which is vulnerable and expressive. When you are an actor, you also understand that vulnerability is extremely attractive. Aggression cannot attract people the way vulnerability does. Its only human to be vulnerable, so as a man you should be okay with it.\" On the work front, Shahid Kapoor will next be seen in Deva, which will release in theatres on February 14, 2025. He will also be collaborating with Triptii Dimri for an upcoming film by Vishal Bhardwaj.",

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/KARAN-EYE-SCREEN-1600.jpg",
    "description1": "Almost four years ago, when Punjabi powerhouse Diljit Dosanjh wanted a song looking back at his two-decade career, he roped in Indo-Canadian Punjabi popstar and friend Karan Aujla to write for him. Precisely 10 minutes after the phone call, G.O.A.T (Greatest of All Time) came to life in Aujla’s Vancouver home in 2020 and became a banger at breakneck speed. A staple and one of the most-loved pieces at every Dosanjh concert that followed thereafter, including the famed Coachella and his Dil-luminati tour this year, it was also the finale piece at Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show in June. Aujla had dropped a coup d’etat of sorts. The vibe landed and the song came with a power punch — Dekh Bollywood vich jinne Khan ne/Ohna vich behnda sardaar, goriye (Look at all these Khans in Bollywood/This Sardar sits among them, my beautiful girl), was laden with imagery unheard of in the mainstream industry — of a Sikh entertainer being equated with Bollywood royalty, the Khans. Dosanjh was already breaking social and cultural stereotypes by being a global superstar who wore his dastaar (turban) and often a traditional folk outfit during his concerts; Aujla’s lines created a lyrical space where being a sardar, with all its symbols, was actually cool. “Many of us have always had an issue with the portrayal of Sikh characters in films, often caricaturised to suit directorial needs. Diljit has changed that. This line, this song by Karan Aujla succinctly portrays that,” says popular Punjabi singer Jassie Gill. Karan Aujla, in a conversation with SCREEN, says that while working with Diljit Dosanjh pushed him to elevate his own craft, songwriting feels instinctive to him and that he “avoids overthinking”. “When I sit down to write, I let emotions and ideas flow freely. My surroundings, personal experiences and the cultural background I come from all fuel my inspiration…Ultimately, I strive for authenticity in my lyrics. I want listeners to connect with the stories I tell through genuine emotions and relatable experiences. That connection is what makes my music resonate and I believe it’s the cornerstone of my songwriting process,” says Aujla. This year, he followed up G.O.A.T and an album titled Making Memories (2023) with his Bollywood debut – Tauba Tauba — an emphatic combination of breezy rhymes, a cheerful flute and a full piano melody paired with Punjabi lines raving about a stunner in the throaty Malwai dialect. Tauba Tauba, a song he wrote, composed and sang, from an otherwise lost cause of a film (Bad Newz, 2024), turned out to be one of this year’s biggest hits from Bollywood, which has been banking on remixes to survive. Aujla says he intentionally kept the lyrics simple. “Hindi really isn’t me. I wanted to familiarise a lot more people with Punjabi,” says Aujla. Authentic Punjabi lines with a contemporary, rakish energy was just the edge Aujla needed to get the song to ring up the charts. If Tauba Tauba offered Karan Aujla phenomenal success, two Junos (considered the Canadian Grammys) earlier this year from the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences for his song Softly, 2023 (which goes by the line Chunni meri rang de lalaariya), announced the arrival of a rare talent. While one was for being the ‘Breakthrough Artist of the Year’, the other was the Audience Choice Award, which has previously gone to the likes of Avril Lavigne, Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes, among others. It also marked another first — it made Aujla the only Punjabi artiste to land a Juno. The award, he says, was “a reminder of staying true to my roots” and “pushing boundaries”. “This award celebrates the hard work and talent of countless artistes in our scene. It highlights the global appeal of Punjabi music and shows that Indian artistes are making their mark on the international stage… I hope this inspires more Punjabi artistes to pursue their dreams and showcase the richness of our culture to a wider audience,” says Aujla. Several Punjabi hits in a year, a quick turnaround time (from writing a song to its recording), writing for almost 23 Punjabi artistes besides creating his own singing career, and collaborations with rappers Badshah and DIVINE, have put Aujla on a global map. “At this point, I am going to call him the biggest artiste in the Indian subcontinent. Karan is a brilliant performer, who is futuristic in his approach. Punjabi music is now changing every four months. He figures out what will work and executes it very quickly,” says Satvinder Singh Kohli, managing director, Speed Records Private Ltd, the biggest Punjabi music label in India. Gill believes that Aujla has become so free with his art now “that he is experimenting wonderfully and the results are brilliant”. Kohli, who is a Dosanjh acolyte himself, says that while the former is a global superstar and a brilliant performer, he is not writing and composing his songs. “Karan is first a lyricist and composer and then a singer,” says Kohli, who adds that most of Aujla’s audience comes from the Gen Z space. “His is a relatively younger audience. Those born after 1998 are listening to him and how,” says Kohli. &nbsp; View this post on Instagram &nbsp; A post shared by Karan Aujla (@karanaujla) This month, Karan Aujla begins his debut India tour, ‘It’s All A Dream’, tickets for which are selling out fast, and priced as high as Rs 15 lakh. “This tour means a lot more than just performing; it’s about connecting with my fans on a deeper level and sharing my music in the country that shaped me as an artiste. While my recent tours in the UK, Australia, and Canada were amazing, India hits different because it’s a homecoming of sorts,” says Aujla, who will be touring Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Jaipur, among other cities. Some stories aren’t meant to be. Even Aujla hasn’t been able to fathom how a 14-year-old from an agricultural family in Ghurala, a speck of a village in Punjab — who had lost both his parents as a young boy and had turned to writing as a refuge and worked as a longshoreman — became a pop star only a few years later. “Sometimes I can’t believe I am that same kid who lost his parents in India, made his way out to Canada… If you are dreaming, make sure you dream big,” said Aujla, in his acceptance speech at the Junos, remembering the toughest phase of his life. The youngest of three siblings, Karan grew up as Jaskaran Aujla. He lost his father to a motorcycle accident when he was just nine and his mother to gallbladder cancer five years later. Brought up by the family of his father’s younger brother, writing songs, he says, was the only real expression for him. While some of this poetry was melancholic, so",
    "description2": "me others carried a sense of hope. “Writing was a way for me to process my emotions during that challenging time. I wrote about loss, heartache and longing. It felt like a cathartic experience that laid the foundation for my musical journey, helping me find my voice and connect with others. I didn’t know how to talk about it to anybody, but I slowly realised I could turn songwriting into a hobby and then a profession,” says Aujla, Aujla was in class IX when his first song, Cell Phone, with singer Mac Benipal, whom he met at a wedding, was released on YouTube. The song, which spoke about feeling lost and alone amidst grinding poverty, tanked. “That song happened when I was 15. Looking back, every struggle taught me something valuable. It was those hard times that shaped my identity,” says Aujla. It was on a visit to Chandigarh with Benipal that Aujla discovered luxury SUVs, especially the Range Rover, and became fascinated with it. He eulogised the car and wrote Range, a song based on the rhyme and meter of Cell Phone, but this time describing the feeling of owning the luxury car. Gill, whom Aujla met when he was 14, was then an upcoming singer from the neighbouring village of Jandali. With a few hit songs in tow, he was already doing shows in Punjab. Aujla found out that Gill frequented his friend’s salon in Khanna, met him and offered him the lyrics of Range. “It was surprising that it had come from such a young boy. There were some very intricate things and rhythmically the song landed perfectly,” says Gill. The song became Aujla’s calling card to approach other producers. During those early writing years, he also started looking up online tutorials and interacting with established producers whilst experimenting with different styles. “I draw inspiration from both traditional Punjabi poetry and contemporary music,” says Aujla, who was always drawn to the work of Kuldeep Manak and Gurdas Mann. Range (Replay, Speed Records) came out in 2014 and was an instant hit. But by that time, Aujla had already immigrated to Canada to live with his sisters. “He was really young then and wanted to be featured in the music videos, but the new boys weren’t keen to give him a chance then,” says Kohli. The move to Canada from Ghurala in his early teens was a significant transition. “It was a mix of anxiety and nervousness…with a different culture, lifestyle and way of life,” says Aujla, who also figured that this was the space where he could express himself more freely. He found himself amid a multi-cultural setting that broadened his horizons. “It was inspiring to see how diverse communities came together and celebrated their heritage. This experience fuelled my creativity and encouraged me to explore new sounds and influences in my music. Over time, I began to find my place, build friendships, and embrace the opportunities. It became a pivotal chapter in my life, shaping both my identity and my musical journey,” says Aujla, who after high school took up a part-time job as a longshoreman in Surrey, British Columbia. As he loaded and unloaded cargo on the docks and learned the value of hard work, deep down he knew it was a temporary phase. “During those long hours, I would daydream about my music and the impact I wanted to make. It was a tough environment, but it motivated me to push harder for my dreams. That experience reinforced my belief in pursuing my passion. It reminded me that every struggle can lead to growth, and ultimately, I knew I was meant to share my stories through music. It was all part of the journey to get where I am today,” says Aujla. He soon met Punjabi composers and producers Deep Jandu and Elly Mangat and began writing lyrics for them. This also led him to write for Jazzy B and Bohemia, two big names in the circuit. His song Blessings of Bapu (2015) sung by Gagan Kokri found some attention back home. But Aujla wasn’t still a familiar name because he wasn’t the face of the songs. Also, the concept of credit for the lyricist was a bit muddled. What changed the game for him was a song called Don’t Worry (2018) featuring Punjabi singer Gurlez Akhtar, which captured his personality, helping him connect with the fans. “I was still navigating my way through the music industry. The song captured the essence of facing life’s challenges with a positive outlook, which resonated deeply with many people,” says Aujla. He didn’t look back from here, releasing one song after another, most of them blending hip-hop with a typical Punjabi sound identity. The audience was lapping it up and asking for more. In the last few decades, Punjab’s cultural identity has seen a big transformation. Shrinking agriculture prospects, lack of jobs and industry have led motifs in older songs that spoke of births, weddings and military life and rich Punjabi literature, to be replaced by lyrics dominated by guns, drugs and misogyny, among others. The loss of innocence and its replacement by a certain aggressive culture in Punjabi songs has been a prominent cultural shift, buoyed by the Internet. Aujla’s rivalry with slain singer Siddhu Moosewala was also a consequence of being in the same gun-toting, sabre-rattling space. The two started off as friends, but conversation leaks led to both sides dissing each other through their songs. Aujla blames “the pressures of fame, expectations from fans, and the aggressive nature of the industry” for the conflicts and misunderstandings. “It is a reminder of how fragile relationships can be in this industry and how important it is to communicate openly and respectfully. I hope that artistes can learn from such situations and focus on creating music that brings people together rather than allowing conflicts to divide us. It’s crucial to prioritise our artistry and the message we want to convey, while also remembering the importance of unity within the music community,” says Aujla. A couple of years before Moosewala’s death, Karan Aujla was also asked by Chandigarh police to refrain from songs glorifying violence and drugs. He agreed to make the change. “As an artiste with a large following, I recognise my responsibility. I’ve become more mindful about my lyrical choices and believe in striking a balance between hard and soft tracks. It’s about creating a body of work that is both relatable and responsible. My music will maintain that balance while evolving with the changing industry landscape,” says Aujla, who is all set for a new, big release with Dosanjh besides the upcoming tour. “This tour is not just about performing; it’s about celebrating our culture, Punjabi music and sharing it in the country that shaped me as an artiste,” he says.",

    "description1": "Pushpa 2 Advance Booking: Pushpa 2: The Rule is expected to rewrite records in the Indian box-office and from the trends in booking across the country, it is clear that the Sukumar directorial will definitely meet those expectations. According to trade website Sacnilk, the advance bookings for Pushpa 2: The Rule is growing from strength to strength, and the film has already collected Rs 30.92 crore for Day 1. With three more days left for the release, and Allu Arjun and team Pushpa amping up the promotions, the numbers might just surprise everyone.  ALSO READ: Allu Arjun’s Pushpa 2 The Rule on the way to blockbuster opening, Telangana government clears decks Almost 7 lakh tickets have been sold across all the languages and formats Pushpa 2: The Rule is being released. The film will be out in 2D, 3D, IMAX, and 4DX. As expected, it is the Telugu numbers that have reached dizzying heights, but what has been really interesting is the numbers of the Hindi version not lagging behind by much. For instance, the advance booking numbers for the Telugu versions of Pushpa 2 has amounted to Rs 10.57 crore, and the Hindi numbers amount to Rs 10.14 crore. Even on the number of tickets sold, the Hindi version has 3,40,892 while the Telugu version is at 2,73,519. This is something unprecedented in recent Indian cinema history. While the Telugu 2D version has outperformed every other language, it is all about the Hindi version in the 3D and IMAX formats. Incidentally, the opening weekend collection of the Hindi version of Pushpa 1 was around Rs 13 crore, and Pushpa 2 would comfortably sail past this number on Day 1. The Malayalam version of Pushpa 2 is also doing considerably well, but the Tamil and Kannada versions are picking up slowly.

Interestingly, Kalki 2989 AD, the highest-grossing film of the year, made Rs 61 crores in advance booking for Day 1. It went on to make Rs 95.3 on Day 1 of its release, and it would be interesting to see if Pushpa 2: The Rule breaches the Rs 100 crore mark domestically on Day 1. The fact that there are paid premieres on December 4 where the Telangana government has allowed a price hike might just facilitate a massive opening for the film.  Pushpa 2 Cast and Crew With Allu Arjun playing the titular role, Pushpa 2: The Rule will see the return of Rashmika Mandanna, Fahadh Faasil, Rao Ramesh, Sunil, Ajay Ghosh, Dhananjaya, and Prathap Bhandari who would be reprising their roles from the first instalment.  Despite a public tiff with the makers regarding the issue of delay in scoring the background music, Devi Sri Prasad has delivered a chartbuster album once again. The latest song, Peelings, has attained viral popularity within hours of its release.

Priyanka, who won Miss India title in the year 2000 and was later crowned Miss World, had to go through a lot of hardships to achieve her goal. In a recent interview on the Something Bigger Show, Madhu revealed that she had to quit her medical practice for PeeCee's career because of her husband's patriarchal family. Recalling the difficult period of convincing her husband, late Ashok Chopra, to send Priyanka to Mumbai for Miss India, she shared, \"Priyanka was studying in 12th standard and was about to give her board exams, so telling her dad and convincing him to say yes during her gap year was another task. Both the kids came and kept asking him. He said, 'Boards are not easy, let her study, don't bring in all these distractions'. After that, children were disappointed so they went downstairs to their bedroom.\" Madhu continued, \"Then I asked him, 'How many people in this country get this opportunity?' She is in the gap year and this is an opportunity that has come out of nowhere. Its just a matter of a week max. So, he said okay.

He said, 'You people are putting ideas into your child's head. Girls from our family don't do this'. We heard a lot, Priyanka cried a lot. She thought bade papa would melt but he said no. Then, I spoke to his wife and said, 'Again the same thing. Its an opportunity, its not like she is going away from home. If she makes it, fine, if she doesn't, she goes back to school. There is no pressure on her'.\" \"Next morning, he sat me down and said that she can go but you have to forget your medical practice and you will be there with her every minute. You will go to Bombay with her, I said okay and promised. My husband also said that I will work for the two of us, I will take care of the practice,\" Madhu added. Eventually, her mum became her travelling partner. \"I was with her for 5-6 years after winning. I used to travel with her everywhere, every shoot, even in Bombay or anywhere in India.

The actor, who made his Bollywood debut with Vikramaditya Motwane's Lootera, had opened up about his career and relationship with money, in an interview earlier this year. In a video on Unfiltered by Samdish, Vikrant revealed he left TV even though he was being paid ₹35 lakh a month, to enter the film industry. The actor had started by narrating the story of how he was treated when his friends saw where he lived. He said, \"I once called some of my closest friends home in college. My mom cooks really well, so I called everyone home to eat. But when they saw my home, the plastic chairs, chipping paint, leaky ceiling, how the kitchen isn’t aesthetically clean, their behaviour changed… They left within an hour of coming to my home.

After I bought the home, paid off debts, gave my parents a better life, I still couldn’t sleep peacefully. I quit at that stage because good work felt more important. All my savings were exhausted and Sheetal (his wife) would lend me money to attend auditions,\" he said. Meanwhile, Vikrant Massey announced his retirement from acting at the prime of his professional life, leaving everyone shocked. After being praised for his performances in 12th Fail and Sector 36, he was last seen in The Sabarmati Report, based on the 2002 Godhra train burning incident in Gujarat, which is still running in theatres. Directed by Dheeraj Sarna, the film also stars Raashii Khanna and Riddhi Dogra in pivotal roles. According to Sacnilk, the film has earned ₹28.25 crore at the domestic box office, in its 17-day run so far.",
