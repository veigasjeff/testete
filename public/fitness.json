    "description1": "After sharing his diet, fitness, and meditation routine, actor and host Rohit Bose Roy recently revealed that he intends to have a \"swimmer's body.\" \"I am very close to where I want to be. I want a lean body. I want a swimmer's body. Now, the whole desire is to be fit and healthy from within. Ever since Covid-19, my whole thought process has changed,\" Roy said during a conversation with actor Larissa Bonesi and fitness trainer Apurva Tilwani on his Unstoppable podcast. What is a swimmer's body? A \"swimmer's body\" is often admired for its lean, muscular build, characterised by broad shoulders, a narrow waist, and well-defined muscles. Dr Arvind Aggarwal, senior consultant, internal medicine, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, told indianexpress.com that a swimmer's body is characterised by a lean, toned, and athletic physique with broad shoulders, a strong core, and a streamlined appearance. \"This body type results from muscle strength, low body fat, and flexibility, honed through swimming and complementary exercises,\" said Dr Aggarwal. This body type is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functionally efficient for swimming. Achieving a swimmer's body involves a combination of swimming, strength training, and proper nutrition, said Mukul Nagpaul, founder of Pmftraining and Fit India Movement Ambassador. Swimming is a full-body workout that engages muscles that are often hard to target with other forms of exercise. It works the shoulders, back, core, and legs, promoting muscle endurance and cardiovascular fitness. \"The resistance of water provides a low-impact environment, reducing the risk of injury while effectively building strength and stamina,\" noted Nagpaul. How to",
    "description2": " build a swimmer’s body To develop this physique, you should focus on a combination of swimming, strength training, and good nutrition, said Nagpaul. Swim regularly: Swimming laps with strokes like freestyle, butterfly, or backstroke, engages multiple muscle groups, burns calories, and improves endurance. Strength training: Incorporate resistance exercises targeting the upper body, core, and legs. \"Pull-ups, planks, and weighted squats are excellent choices,\" said Dr Aggarwal. Focus on flexibility: Stretching exercises and yoga can enhance mobility, which is crucial for efficient swimming movements. Balanced nutrition: Consume a protein-rich diet with healthy fats and carbohydrates to fuel workouts and aid muscle recovery. Dos and don’ts It's important to note that while swimming is excellent for building a lean physique,\" it should be complemented with land-based exercises to ensure balanced muscle development\". \"Additionally, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including adequate sleep and stress management, is vital for achieving and sustaining a swimmer's body,\" said Nagpaul. - Maintain proper swimming techniques to prevent injuries. A coach can help refine your strokes. - Don’t overtrain without rest days, which may lead to fatigue or injuries. - Prioritise hydration and recovery after workouts. - Dr Aggarwal said not to neglect cardio and overall fitness, as swimming alone may not suffice. Consistency, proper training, and a balanced lifestyle are key to achieving this coveted physique, said Dr Aggarwal.

    "description": "Breakfasts tailored to individual metabolic needs could revolutionize how men and women manage their weight and overall health.",
    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/11/breakfast-options.jpg",
    "description1": "Recent research published in Computers in Biology and Medicine reveals that men and women benefit from distinct breakfast compositions due to differences in their metabolism. The study highlights that men’s bodies are better equipped to process energy from high-carbohydrate breakfasts, while women respond more effectively to breakfasts rich in healthy fats. The findings elaborate on how tailoring meals to biological differences can optimise energy utilisation and weight management. Understanding metabolic differences in men and women According to Susmita N., Clinical Nutritionist, Cloudnine Group of Hospitals, Bangalore, the metabolic differences between men and women are driven by hormonal, genetic, and physiological factors, which influence how the body processes carbohydrates and fats. Here's a breakdown of these differences: Carbohydrate Metabolism Insulin Sensitivity Women: Premenopausal women generally have greater insulin sensitivity due to the influence of estrogen, making them more efficient at regulating blood sugar levels. Men: Men are more prone to insulin resistance, increasing their risk of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes. Glucose Utilization Women utilize glucose more effectively for immediate energy, particularly during exercise. Men, on the other hand, tend to rely more on fat for energy during physical activity. Carbohydrate Storage Thanks to their higher muscle mass, men have larger glycogen reserves in muscles and the liver. Women conserve glycogen during prolonged activities, relying more on fat for energy. Fat Metabolism Fat Storage Women: Estrogen encourages fat storage in subcutaneous areas like the hips and thighs, which is essential for reproductive health. Men: Tend to store fat around organs (visceral fat), which poses higher",
    "description2": " health risks. Fat Utilization Women excel at fat oxidation, especially during low-intensity exercise and recovery periods. Men are less efficient at burning fat, relying more on carbohydrates. Post-Exercise Fat Burning Women’s bodies shift toward burning fat post-exercise, even at lower intensities, offering a metabolic advantage. Hormonal Influence on Metabolism Women Estrogen supports fat metabolism, enhances insulin sensitivity, and minimizes visceral fat accumulation. Hormonal cycles during menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause affect energy needs and fat storage. Men Testosterone drives muscle growth, elevating the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and calorie burn at rest. However, it also predisposes men to visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance. How can their diets be tailored for optimal health? Sushmita suggested the following: For Weight Loss Men: High-protein, low-carb diets complement their higher BMR and help leverage muscle mass for faster weight loss. Women: Hormonal wiring makes quick weight loss challenging. Long-term success requires balanced diets rich in nutrients and consistent exercise. For Energy Management Men: High-carbohydrate breakfasts help meet their energy demands and fuel physical activity. Women: Healthy fats, like those found in nuts and avocados, support sustained energy and efficient fat metabolism. For Health Risks Pre-menopausal women are naturally protected against heart disease and diabetes but face increased risks post-menopause. Men are more vulnerable to visceral fat-related diseases but benefit from quick weight loss with lifestyle interventions.

    "description1": "Indian-origin Scottish artist Jasleen Kaur has won the prestigious Turner Prize 2024 for her exhibition, “Alter Altar”, that reflects on plurality, personal and political themes. The jury — chaired by Alex Farquharson, Director, Tate Britain — praised “the considered way in which Kaur weaves together the personal, political and spiritual… choreographing a visual and aural experience that suggests both solidarity and joy”. It also highlighted Kaur’s “ability to gather different voices through unexpected and playful combinations of material”. At 38, Kaur was the youngest nominee for this year’s award that includes a cash prize of £25,000. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the prize. The other shortlisted artists included Pio Abad, Claudette Johnson and Delaine Le Bas. Born in Glasgow, Kaur’s great-grandfather reportedly moved from Punjab in 1950, three years after Partition; her father owns a hardware store in Scotland. Her prize-winning exhibition “Alter Altar”, first shown in Glasgow last year, also reflects on her own family history as migrants to Scotland and her upbringing. It featured, among others, a vintage red Ford Escort covered with a huge crocheted doily, a reference to her father’s migrant aspirations, worship bells, Irn-Bru orange resin, an Axminster carpet, and family photographs. Also playing were soundtracks that were part of Kaur’s growing up years, from Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan to Bob Marley. In several interviews, Kaur has often discussed her multicultural upbringing and influences. If her 2021 series, “Gut Feelings Meri Jaan”, explored ideas around inheritance and belonging, history and archive, in the 2018 “I Keep Telling Them These Stories”, she used archival foota",
    "description2": "ge and recordings gathered from India and Scotland to explore culture as praxis, family, identity and origins. Her 2019 publication, “Be Like Teflon”, commissioned by Panel for Glasgow Women's Library, comprises conversations between Kaur and women of Indian heritage living in the UK. Her website describes her as: “An artist making with the slurry of life. Raised amidst betrayal, secrecy and banished outsiders, her work is to make sense of what is out of view or withheld. She is called towards plurality, declassifications, polyphony, the blur. She is practising singing in the sediment till she is intoxicated.” In an interview on the Tate website, Kaur states: “There’s this particular theory that I grew up with from the Sikh tradition which talks about Miri Piri, which is this balance of the political and the spiritual. I’m really interested in that duality and I’ve become quite obsessed with this particular point in my lineage where devotional practices were done across religious lines. That was happening for hundreds of years. But through the violence of borders, the violence of colonialism, the violence of empire, so much of this stuff, it has been impacted. And I'm obsessed with it because it tells me that there's a different way to live together.” In her acceptance speech for the award on Tuesday, the Royal College of Art alumnus called for a ceasefire in Gaza, an end to institutional complicity in Israel’s genocide, and an arms embargo. She is also one of the signatories to a letter demanding that Tate sever ties with organisations that are deeply complicit with the Israeli regime. “It's not a radical demand. This should not risk an artist's career or safety,” she said in her speech.",

    "description1": "Chef Neha Deepak Shah recently shared her experience of finding relief after consuming a homemade cough syrup made with orange and some kitchen spices. According to the MasterChef India finalist, the concoction \"worked well for me.\" \"I was not feeling too well last week and tried this at home, and it instantly helped me get better,\" said Shah, further advising that one should have \"one spoon of this every 4 to 5 hours for 3 days (make a fresh one every day) and see the magic\". Ingredients 1 - Orange 1 tsp - Salt ½ tsp - Turmeric A pinch of black pepper A pinch of cinnamon Honey Method Cut the top of an orange and drill a hole to extract juice and pulp. Heat the orange along with the cover. Add each of the spices and salt. Once it is warm, switch off the flame to avoid burning it. Cool the orange before adding honey for best results. Does it work? Dr Narendra Singhla, lead consultant, internal medicine, CK Birla Hospital, Delhi, said orange juice combined with turmeric and other spices can be an effective natural remedy for cough. \"Turmeric contains curcumin, a compound with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that enhance immune function. When paired with the immune-boosting vitamin C in orange juice, turmeric helps reduce throat inflammation and fight infections, alleviating cough symptoms,\" said Dr Singhla. He added that ginger, another common addition to this remedy, has natural anti-inflammatory properties that further support relief from inflammation and soothe the throat. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; View this post on Instagram &nbsp; A post shared by @nehadeepakshah &nbsp; &nbsp; How do you consume it for optimum results? For best results, consume this mixture warm to maximise its soothing effects, and adjust the spice levels according to your taste and sensitivity, suggested Dr Singhla. \"This remedy can also be complemented with othe",
    "description2": "r natural cough relievers like honey and lemon for added benefits,\" he said. However, Jinal Patel, dietician at Zynova Shalby Hospital Mumbai, said that while promising, it may not help cure a cough. \"Instead, it could worsen your cough and the symptoms. Orange is a citrus food that is usually high in acidity. Eating oranges when constantly coughing can irritate the throat and increase sensitivity, making it harder to recover. Adding spices like black pepper and cinnamon to the orange can also aggravate your throat by causing a burning sensation when eaten in excess quantity or frequently. Turmeric and honey are often praised for their range of health benefits making them suitable for combating cough. But when these ingredients are combined with acidic and strong spices like black pepper, it may not work for everyone,\" Patel told indianexpress.com. This concoction works by combining immunity-boosting nutrients with natural anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. \"While turmeric and ginger have proven health benefits, the effectiveness of this specific mix against coughs depends on the type and severity of the condition. For instance, a mild cough due to a cold might benefit more from this remedy than one caused by allergies or infections,\" said dietitian Vidhi Chawla, founder of Fisico Diet and Aesthetic Clinic. It is important to consult a healthcare professional if the cough persists or worsens over time, said Dr Singhla. While orange juice with turmeric and spices isn’t a guaranteed cure, \"it can be a helpful addition to your diet for mild cough relief and overall wellness. For persistent or severe symptoms, consulting a healthcare professional is crucial,\" said Chawla.

    "description1": "For many, shifting from a diet dominated by junk food to one filled with nutritious choices can be a difficult but life-changing journey.  Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan’s sister, Sunaina Roshan, recently shared her own experience of moving away from unhealthy eating habits after being diagnosed with jaundice, a condition worsened by fatty liver disease.  Taking to her Instagram, she shared, “I would basically eat everything and anything under the sun that was unhealthy. Pizzas, burgers, you name it and I was eating it. There was nothing healthy going into my body.” She continued, “What made my jaundice severe also was that I had grade 3 fatty liver, and we all know that with jaundice, you can’t eat masala, fried (food). For me, to make that switch became much easier and it happened day by day, step by step. My advice to all of you would be: don’t let pain or illness change you to making healthier choices. Do not be lazy about it. Do not be fearful.” Sunaina’s story highlights a common struggle for those looking to improve their diet: staying on track without aiming for unrealistic standards. Small, steady changes are often more sustainable, and setbacks are part of the journey.  Strategies for gradually transitioning from a junk food-heavy diet to a healthier, more balanced one Ashlesha Joshi, senior nutritionist at Tone 30 Pilates, says, “Transitioning from a diet high in junk food to a more balanced, nutritious one can seem overwhelming, but small, consistent steps make it manageable. Start by incorporating more whole foods gradually - such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains - into daily meals. For instance, add a side salad with lunch or swap sugary snacks for a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts.” Another helpful approach is meal planning, she adds. “Preparing meals in advance, even if it’s just for a few days, can reduce the temptation to reach for convenient junk food when hunger strikes. This doesn’t have to be complex; simple, easy-to-make recipes incorp",
    "description2": "orating balanced nutrients go a long way.”  Lastly, aim for a “crowding out” approach - gradually replace one junk food item with a healthier alternative each week. Over time, this can shift dietary habits in a way that feels achievable rather than restrictive. Staying motivated to maintain healthy eating habits over time Joshi mentions that setting small, attainable goals can also boost motivation. “Achieving small milestones reinforces a sense of accomplishment and builds positive momentum over time.” Tracking progress with a journal or app can also provide visual evidence of progress, helping reinforce commitment to healthy habits. Additionally, celebrating small wins, like choosing a healthier option or hitting a weekly nutrition goal, keeps motivation high and creates positive associations with lifestyle changes. Dietary changes for individuals dealing with conditions like fatty liver disease and jaundice Dr Pranav Honnavara Srinivasan, consultant gastroenterologist at Fortis Hospitals, says, “Reducing processed foods and refined sugars is crucial, as these foods can exacerbate liver stress and inflammation.” A diet rich in antioxidants and fibre is particularly beneficial, he adds. Leafy greens, berries, and foods high in omega-3 fatty acids - such as fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts - help reduce inflammation and support liver cell regeneration. “For those dealing with jaundice, adequate hydration and including more water-rich foods, such as cucumbers and watermelon, can support the body’s natural detoxification processes. Replacing red meats with lean proteins like chicken, legumes, and tofu also reduces liver strain,” says Dr Srinivasan.  Dr Srinivasan suggests that limiting alcohol intake and avoiding saturated fats are essential steps in managing these conditions, as both contribute to liver strain and fat accumulation. “Working with a nutritionist can provide tailored advice that accommodates individual needs, especially when managing chronic conditions.”",

    "description1": "Air purifiers have become essential appliances in many homes, especially with the rising AQI levels. But are they safe for your furry companions? According to Dr Umesh Kallahalli, Senior Vet at Mars Petcare, air purifiers are generally safe and can benefit humans and pets by reducing allergens, pet dander, and pollutants in the air. However, he emphasises that selecting the right purifier is crucial to ensure comfort and safety for pets. Noise levels: A key consideration Dr Kallahalli points out that some air purifiers emit sounds that may cause anxiety in pets, particularly if they produce high-pitched tones or operate loudly. To mitigate this, he recommends choosing models with noise levels below 50 decibels (dB), akin to a quiet conversation. Many modern purifiers now feature \"silent\" or \"night\" modes designed to operate with minimal noise, making them more pet-friendly. This thoughtful design can significantly reduce stress in noise-sensitive animals. Choosing a pet-safe air purifier When selecting an air purifier for a household with pets, Dr Kallahalli advises considering these factors: Avoid Ozone-Generating Purifiers Ozone can harm humans and animals, so avoiding purifier",
    "description2": "s with ozone-generating features is best. Instead, opt for models with HEPA or activated carbon filters, which effectively capture allergens and odours without compromising safety. Quiet Operation Loud or high-pitched noises may stress pets, especially those with sensitive hearing. To maintain a calm environment for your pets, a purifier with a noise level below 50 decibels (dB) is ideal. Room Size and Purifier Coverage Ensure the purifier is appropriately sized for the room. A unit that’s too small may fail to filter the air effectively, while an oversized one could create unnecessary noise or air circulation, potentially unsettling pets. Washable Pre-Filters Purifiers with washable pre-filters can benefit homes with pets. These pre-filters capture larger particles like pet hair, reducing the need for frequent filter replacements and saving costs. Certified Safety Standards When purchasing an air purifier, check for certifications and compliance with safety standards. This ensures the device is effective and safe for all household members. Clean air can make a noticeable difference in pets' comfort and overall health, especially those with respiratory sensitivities or allergies.",

    "description1": "Digital creator and actor Kusha Kapila recently opened up about her struggles with adult acne and how strength training has become an unexpected ally in managing her skin health.  In a podcast hosted by Mira Kapoor, she said, “Strength training helps with my acne. If I do not work out for two weeks, I have a new pimple.” She continued, “Adult acne is the worst but when I was 29 I had this acne which I had no idea where it was coming from… until I found out that it was my hormones and PCOS (sic).” When asked if she had a cult favourite, she shared that while dealing with persistent breakouts can be frustrating, the \"sweat glow\" from regular workouts gives her skin a renewed vitality when other remedies fall short. “My cult favourite is just working out… when nothing works just that sweat glow is the best glow.” &nbsp; View this post on Instagram &nbsp; A post shared by Skoda KushaK (@kushakapila_20) Acne, especially in adulthood, can stem from a variety of factors, including hormones, stress, and lifestyle choices. While skincare routines and medical treatments are common solutions, could exercise like strength training offer additional benefits? Dr Swetha Sridhar, consultant dermatologist and assistant professor at Lady Curzon and Bowring Hospital, tells indianexpress.com, “Hormonal imbalance is a major cause of adult acne, and exercise plays a pivotal role in regulating these hormones. High cortisol levels from chronic stress can trigger increased sebum production, leading to acne. Strength training reduces cortisol levels, helping to stabilise sebum production.” Insulin resistance can contribute to acne by increasing androgen activity, she says, which stimulates oil glands. Strength training enhances insulin sensitivity, reducing androgen spikes and preventing acne flare-ups. Exercise boosts endorphins, the ‘feel-good’ hormones, which reduce stress and its negative",
    "description2": " impact on the skin. “For women, hormonal fluctuations during menstrual cycles often cause breakouts. Regular exercise helps regulate oestrogen and progesterone levels, mitigating these effects,” stresses Dr Sridhar. “A study published in The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology found that individuals engaging in consistent exercise had better skin elasticity and fewer inflammatory markers, which are common in acne. Strength training’s ability to regulate these factors makes it particularly effective for promoting clear skin,” says Dr Sridhar. Can sweating during workouts truly benefit the skin? Dr Sridhar explains, “Sweating during workouts can have both benefits and drawbacks for skin health, especially for individuals prone to acne. Sweat opens up pores and flushes out impurities like dead skin cells, dirt, and excess sebum that can clog pores and lead to breakouts.” Sweat carries dermcidin, she adds, a natural antimicrobial peptide that helps fight acne-causing bacteria on the skin’s surface. Precautions for acne-prone skin Dr Sridhar suggests the following: -Pre-Workout Preparation: Remove makeup or heavy skincare products before exercising to prevent pore blockage. Use a gentle, non-comedogenic cleanser to prep the skin. -Post-Workout Cleansing: Wash your face immediately after exercising to remove sweat, oil, and bacteria. Use a mild cleanser with salicylic acid for acne-prone skin. -Avoid Touching Your Face: Gym equipment is a breeding ground for bacteria. Wiping sweat with dirty hands can introduce more irritants to the skin. -Breathable Clothing: Wear moisture-wicking fabrics to reduce sweat buildup and prevent body acne. -Hydration: Drink plenty of water to replenish lost fluids and maintain skin hydration. “While sweating is beneficial, neglecting post-workout hygiene can worsen acne by trapping bacteria and oil on the skin,” cautions Dr Sridhar. ",

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/11/fears.jpg",
    "description1": "From shutting your eyes atop a Ferris wheel to clinging to someone in the dark or panicking at the sight of clowns, childhood fears often follow people into adulthood. Recently, Bollywood veteran Manisha Koirala shared her experience of confronting her childhood fear of cycling. In an Instagram post, she recounted how her friend Sarosh Pradhan helped her conquer this fear after years of avoidance. \"I finally conquered my fear of cycling in traffic today! After 2 years off the saddle, I was nervous, but a good friend Sarosh Pradhan nudged me and kept insisting I need to overcome fear,\" Koirala wrote in her Instagram caption. Psychologist Ashutosh Tiwari from MindGlass Well-Being Private Limited said fear is a healthy, inborn instinct essential for survival of mankind, triggering the fight-or-flight response in dangerous situations. According to him, cycling-related fears were common among 90s kids. “In those days, children learned to balance bicycles through trial and error, often witnessing injuries in the process. This contributed to the anxiety around cycling,” Tiwari said. &nbsp; View this post on Instagram &nbsp; A post shared by Manisha Koirala (@m_koirala) What causes childhood fears? Psychologist Komel Chadha said that when a child feels insecure, it can overshadow their need for affection. “Anything perceived as different or capable of disrupting their sense of security can trigger fear,” she explained. According to her, since children’s cognitive faculties are still developing, it makes them more prone to misinterpret situations and focus on negatives. Dr Rahul Chandok, senior consultant and head of psychiatry at Artemis Lite NFC, New Delhi, said that childhood fears can stem from a variety of sources including developmental milestones, temperament, traumatic experiences or modeling others. \"As children grow, they encounter new experiences and concepts that can be overwhelming or frightening. For example, the fear of the dark is often linked to a child's developing imagination and the inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality. Some children are naturally more anxious or cautious than others. This can make them more prone to developing fears,\" he said. Dr Ambarish Ghosh, consultant psychiatrist at CMRI, said that trauma—such as abuse, neglect, bullying, or parental separation—can leave lasting emotional scars, creating fears that persist into adulthood. \"Manipulative or overly strict parenting can also instill irrational fears and trust issues in children,\" he said. How are they different from irrational fears, phobias, and perceived fears? Jasmine Arora, clinical psychologist consultant at Artemis Hospitals, explained the key distinctions between childhood fears, irrational fears, phobias, and perceived fears: Childhood fears: These are often temporary and related to normal developmental processes. They may not meet the diagnostic criteria for a phobia. Irrational fears: These are fears that are d",
    "description2": "isproportionate to the actual threat posed by a situation or object. They may be based on unrealistic beliefs or distorted thinking patterns. Phobias: These are persistent, excessive, and unreasonable fears of specific objects or situations. They significantly interfere with daily life and can cause significant distress. Perceived fears: These are fears that are based on a person's subjective interpretation of a situation. They may not be objectively justified but still cause significant anxiety. What are some effective ways for people to overcome their childhood fears? Dr Chandok said that it is possible to treat childhood fears in adulthood. Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is a common approach that helps individuals identify and challenge negative thoughts and behaviours associated with their fears. Exposure therapy, another effective technique, involves gradually exposing individuals to the feared stimulus in a controlled setting. \"In some cases, medication may be used in conjunction with therapy to manage anxiety and fear symptoms. However, medication is typically not a standalone treatment and should be used under the guidance of a mental health professional,\" he said. Dr Ghosh said that these fears, if not addressed during childhood, can resurface in adulthood due to psychological regression, where unresolved emotions from early years return. Therapies such as psychotherapy and regression therapy allow individuals to revisit and process their childhood experiences, identifying the root causes of their fears. Psychotherapy provides tools to reframe traumatic memories, while regression therapy guides individuals to confront and release their pain. He also said that overcoming childhood fears requires a combination of parental involvement during childhood and therapeutic intervention if these fears persist into adulthood. Parents and caregivers play a pivotal role in helping children navigate their fears. It is essential for parents to provide consistent emotional support and observe changes in their child’s behavior. \"Signs such as a fear of specific individuals, avoidance behaviours, difficulty concentrating, or social withdrawal may indicate underlying fears or phobias. Open communication and reassurance can help children feel safe, while professional counselling sessions can address the root causes of their fears,\" he said. Dr Chandok stressed the importance of acknowledging your child’s fears and providing support. Gradual, controlled exposure to the feared situation, coupled with positive reinforcement, can build confidence and reduce anxiety. Modeling healthy ways of coping with fears also teaches children resilience. Arora recommended building a strong support system and adopting coping mechanisms to manage lingering fears. With the right therapeutic approaches, adults can overcome anxiety, panic attacks, and nightmares linked to childhood fears, achieving better mental health and emotional resilience.",

    "description1": "\n\n\nStockholm County [Sweden], December 4 (ANI): Women with oestrogen-sensitive breast cancer now receive anti-hormonal therapy. Researchers have discovered that postmenopausal women with low-risk tumours have a long-term benefit for at least 20 years, whereas younger women with similar tumour characteristics who had not yet gone through menopause benefitted for a shorter period of time.\n\"Younger women generally have a higher risk of recurrence than older postmenopausal women, but most studies on anti-hormonal therapy have mainly included postmenopausal women. We therefore wanted to compare the long-term benefit from the treatment in both groups,\" says Linda Lindstrom, associate professor and research group leader at the Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, who led the study.\n\nIn Sweden, 9 000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, with hormone-sensitive breast cancer accounting for about 75 percent of women diagnosed with the disease. In patients with hormone-sensitive breast cancer tumour growth is mainly driven by oestrogen and patients are therefore treated with oestrogen-suppressing drugs, often tamoxifen.\nHowever, anti-hormonal treatment reduces quality of life and the question has been how the long-term benefit against recurrence looks like. About a third of women diagnosed with breast cancer are younger and have yet not undergone the menopause, i.e. they are premenopausal, and are known to have an increased risk of recurrence.\nThe study includes more than 1,200 women diagnosed with hormone-dependent breast cancer between 1976 and 1997 of which almost 400 were premenopausal. At the start of the study it was not known whether anti-hormonal treatment was beneficial and therefore women were randomised to treatment with tamoxifen for at least two years or no anti-hormonal treatment, i.e. the control group. The outcome of interest was breast cancer metastasis or distant recurrence and today there is follow-up data for more than 20 years after initial diagnosis.\n\n\n\"From",
    "description2": " the regional breast cancer registry, we have an almost complete follow-up on all patients and this together with a control group who did not receive anti-hormonal treatment makes the study unique. There is also complete data on whether the women were pre- or post-menopausal at diagnosis, which is otherwise often estimated based on age,\" says Annelie Johansson, researcher at the same department and the study's first author.\nThe women's tumours were classified as low or high risk based on the clinically used markers. Low risk tumor characteristics were defined as a tumour size of two centimeters in diameter or less, no lymph node spread, low tumour grade, being positive for the progesterone receptor, and a low genomic risk, which was determined by a molecular signature that measures the expression of 70 different genes.\nWomen with high-risk tumours had less benefit against distant recurrence, whether they had gone through menopause or not. Women with low-risk tumours after menopause had a long-term benefit of 20 years or more. For younger women who had not gone through menopause at diagnosis, a long-term benefit could not be predicted using the clinically used markers. Therefore, new markers are needed, the researchers say.\n\"We need to work further to understand which tumour characteristics influence the long-term risk of recurrence and benefit in younger patients. We want patients to benefit from their treatment for as long as the risk of recurrence is elevated,\" says Linda Lindstrom.\nIn the next step, the researchers want to be able to link more complex tumour characteristics to the long-term risk and benefit of anti-hormonal therapy, in order to individualise the treatment to the patients who benefit from it.\n\"For example, we plan to perform multi-protein analyses and use machine learning for image analysis of breast cancer tumours to understand more about tumour heterogeneity - i.e. differences between and within tumors - and how it affects risk and treatment benefit,\" says Linda Lindstrom.

    "description1": "You have probably heard the term gaslighting before; it's a manipulative tactic that is a subtle yet harmful form of emotional manipulation that can make you doubt your own feelings, thoughts, opinions, standards, and reality. This happens when your partner wants to have power and control in the relationship; they will undermine your confidence or opinion to look superior. It is quite difficult to identify at the moment that you are being gaslighted; you would consider their actions and behavior as a protective partner. Gaslighters will aim to confuse you and make you question your own opinions and thoughts. Here’s how to spot signs :  115980887Twisting the truth—If your partner rephrases the story or events to suit their narratives and keeps you in the dark from reality, it's a sign of gaslighting. They will tell the truth they want you to hear by keeping you in the illusion and making up stories to cover up their mistakes. Denying your opinions or thoughts— If your partner keeps telling you that you are overthinking it, imagining it, or that never happened, you need to stop overreacting; you are definitely getting gaslit by your partner; they will deny your feelings",

It's a clear sign you are being gaslit by your partner; they don't care about your feelings or emotions and will make you feel like the one at fault.  115980901Blame Game - Your partner will start playing blame games with you; they will refuse to take responsibility for their actions, blame you for the problems in the relationship and their personal life, and start making you feel guilty if your relationship is not working out. This is a sign of being gaslit by your partner. Isolation—Does your partner disappear from time to time? They say things like, I need to clear my mind, I need some space, and then not text, call, or talk to you for the next 3 to 4 days. If they keep on isolating themselves on a regular basis and ask for time and space, then it's a sign you are being gaslit by your partner.

A study published in Evolutionary Psychological Science set out to explore this question, and the findings are fascinating. With data from 6,338 participants spanning 12 countries like Japan, Greece, and the UK, the research shows that relationships, especially satisfying ones, have a powerful impact on one's emotional well-being and life satisfaction. It highlights just how crucial human connection is when it comes to feeling happier and more fulfilled.  115976404But it isn't just about being in a relationship—it's about the quality. Those in fulfilling, supportive relationships were the ones who benefited most emotionally, experiencing positive emotions of joy and self-assurance and avoiding negative feelings like sadness or guilt.

The emotional benefits of being in a relationship seem to be consistent across the globe, emphasizing the basic human need for connection, no matter where you live.  115976414Being single isn’t always bad—many enjoy the freedom and growth it brings. But this study shows that healthy relationships offer emotional support that’s hard to match. If you're in a happy relationship, appreciate it.

    "description1": "When it comes to choosing the right protein for a healthy heart, the debate between plant protein and animal protein leaves people puzzled. Proteins are essential for muscle repair, energy, and overall well-being, but they can also impact cardiovascular health. Here is all we need to know about the differences and uncover which protein is better for your heart.What are plant proteins and animal proteins?Plant proteins are sourced from plant sources such as legumes, beans, nuts, seeds and whole grains. These proteins are commonly enhanced with fibre, antioxidants, and healthy fats, making them nutrient-rich. In contrast, animal proteins are obtained from meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Although they are complete proteins, meaning they contain all essential amino acids, they are frequently heavy in saturated fats. 115973487What does research say?According to research, plant proteins have been associated with improved heart health results. A 30-year study discovered that people who consume more plant protein than animal protein had a 19% lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and a 27% lower risk of coronary artery disease (CAD).Replacing red and processed meat with plant protein sources like lentils, soy, or nuts was shown to have the greatest cardiovascular benefits. But, consuming fish and lean animal protein, ",
    "description2": "such as chicken, also offers heart-friendly advantages.Why do plant proteins shine for heart health? 115973442Plant proteins bring several heart-boosting benefits: Rich in fibre: Helps lower bad cholesterol (LDL) levels. Low in saturated fats: Reduces the risk of plaque buildup in arteries. Packed with antioxidants: Combats inflammation, a key factor in heart disease.In contrast, some animal proteins, especially red and processed meats, are high in saturated fats and cholesterol, which can increase heart disease risk if consumed excessively.Are all animal proteins bad?Not all animal proteins are harmful to the heart. Fish, for instance, is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are excellent for cardiovascular health. Lean poultry and eggs can also be part of a heart-healthy diet when eaten in balance. Here is what we need to keep in mind processed meats like sausages or frozen meat have been linked to increased risks of heart disease due to their high salt and fat content. 112104776The verdict: Which protein should we choose?For optimal heart health:Adding foods like lentils, quinoa, chickpeas, and nuts into your diet.Replace red and processed meat with plant-based alternatives or lean animal proteins.A mix of plant and lean animal proteins can support your overall health, but the bulk of your diet should lean towards plant sources.",

    "description1": "Optical illusions are amazing visual puzzles that challenge how we see the world around us. These illusions confuse the eyes but also sharpen cognitive abilities and enhance intelligence. One of the most popular optical illusions going viral now is to find hidden sets of zeros in a picture full of the letter 'O.' The task is to find these zeros within a fixed time limit of just 9 seconds, testing your observation skills.Fill a red background image with Os. In one look, it appears to be a random jumble of Os. The challenge lies in discovering the hidden and cleverly placed sets of zeros in the pattern. You will need to focus on the image, attend closely to it, and think quickly to uncover those unseen zeros before time runs out.Not that this mattered, since the clue to solving this puzzle was hidden in a very subtle hint: the zeros appear in the last three rows of the image. Now look at these rows more closely, and after a bit of patience, you should be able to spot them.The optical illusion challenge would state that the set of zeros lies in",
    "description2": " the third-to-last row, right-hand side of the picture, second-to-last column. The most interesting about these zeros is that they are smaller than all the Os in the sheet and this is what makes them harder to locate because of this. Size and position are all engineered for a test on focus and ability to attend to subtlety.This is a rather simple, but effective optical illusion for your observation and brain. Good for you if you were able to spot the zeros within the given 9-second time space; you surely have great eyes and an excellent mind. However, if you are not among them, do not lose hope, as after a few more practices it will be easy to get over such challenges.This optical illusion is not just a funny puzzle but gives us a clue about our perception and cognitive abilities. Much can be learned from the person, including his IQ, attention to detail, and even some hidden personality traits. Whether you solved this illusion or not, it's a great way to engage your brain and learn more about how you perceive the world around you. 115973972",

    "description1": "Tired of trying everything under the sun to burn belly fat with no lasting results? You may not be alone in this. Belly fat is one of the most common concerns in people on a weight loss journey. Abdominal fat is also linked to health risks such as heart disease and diabetes. Losing abdominal tasks is often a task. If you are determined to achieve a leaner and healthier midsection, here are five proven methods to target belly fat effectively.115984091Well balanced diet115984093Though spot reduction is not really an option when it comes to weight loss, focusing on some factors will help you reap extra benefits. Diet plays a crucial role in reducing belly fat. Opting a low-carb diet without processed food can help you to lower your insulin levels which encourages the body to burn stored fat for energy. Instead of refined carbs like white bread and sugary snacks opt for lean proteins, healthy fats, and fiber-rich vegetables. Incorporating healthy fats such as avocados and nuts, as well as eggs and leafy greens in your diet will keep you feeling full for longer periods of time, and thereby avoid cravings. Make exercise a part of your daily routine115984096Along with a well-balanced diet, try to get yourself 30 or 45 minutes of exercise each day, depending on your health. Begin with simple exercises such as a brisk walk, or light cardio sessions. Incorporating High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is effective for weight loss. Adding burpees",
    "description2": ", crunches, mountain climbers, Russian twists, inclined running, and plank can focus on your midsection. Strength training exercises, like squats, lunges, deadlifts, and planks, target multiple muscle groups, increase your resting metabolic rate, and help you burn belly fat. Get a good night’s sleep115984106Sleep is one of the most neglected parts when it comes to weight loss. Remember that poor sleep disrupts hormonal balance, making it tough for you to lose weight. Sleep deprivation also affects hunger and will increase your cravings for unhealthy foods. Aim for 7–8 hours of quality sleep each night so that your body can recover, recharge and refresh. Don’t stress115984125Well, this might sound strange, but controlling your stress levels can help your weight loss journey. Stress is a silent contributor to belly fat. When you’re stressed, your body releases cortisol, which signals the storage of fat around your midsection. Practicing mindfulness, yoga, meditation, deep breathing, or even taking a walk can help lower cortisol levels and aid your fitness goals. 115980619114047804Hydrate115984127There are no quick fixes to reduce belly fat, but hydration is quite crucial. Keeping yourself hydrated is an essential step in any weight loss journey. Water boosts your metabolism, and thereby aids digestion. This will prevent you from overeating. Keep a water bottle handy and aim to drink at least 2–3 liters a day.Pro Tip: Consistency is the key!",

    "description1": "Starting the day right can set the tone for a productive and balanced life, especially when it comes to supporting the body’s natural detox process. The morning is a critical time when your body is transitioning from rest and repair mode to active function, making it the ideal window for reset and rejuvenation. Incorporating simple yet effective habits into your morning routine can help boost your energy, promote digestion, and support overall well-being. But what specific things should you do before 9 am to reset your body and give your detox process a boost? How does the body’s natural detox process work? Ashlesha Joshi, senior nutritionist at Tone30 Pilates, mentions, “The body’s detoxification system is a complex network involving the liver, kidneys, lymphatic system, lungs, skin, and gut. These organs work together to eliminate toxins, waste products, and metabolic byproducts.” The process primarily includes: Liver Function: The liver is the central organ for detoxification. It filters blood, metabolises toxins into water-soluble forms, and secretes them into bile or blood for elimination through urine or faeces. Kidneys: The kidneys filter blood to remove waste and excess fluid, excreting them as urine. Adequate hydration is crucial for optimal kidney function. Gut and Microbiome: The digestive tract eliminates waste via stool, and gut bacteria play a role in neutralising harmful substances. Fibre is essential for supporting gut motility and microbial balance. Lymphatic System: This system collects cellular waste and delivers it to the bloodstream for removal. Physical activity is key to maintaining its function. Lungs and Skin: The lungs expel carbon dioxide, a metabolic waste product, while the skin eliminates toxins through sweat. “Overnight, the liver actively metabolises toxins, making the morning crucial for flushing out these processed wastes through hydration and fibre. ",
    "description2": "Cortisol and enzymatic activity peak in the morning, enhancing digestion and energy production needed for detox,” notes Joshi. Five most important things to do before 9 am to reset your body and support its natural detox process Joshi says, “The morning is a critical time for resetting the body and enhancing its natural detoxification processes.”  These five habits can help optimise this process, according to the nutritionist: Start with Hydration: Upon waking, drink a glass of warm water with lemon. Lemon water provides vitamin C, an antioxidant that supports liver function and boosts digestion. Hydration helps flush out toxins accumulated overnight and rehydrates the body after hours of fasting. Practice Deep Breathing or Meditation: Engage in 5–10 minutes of deep breathing exercises or meditation to reduce stress and improve oxygen flow. Proper oxygenation supports cellular function and the removal of carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism. Stretch or Exercise: Light stretching, yoga, or a quick workout activates the lymphatic system, a critical component of the body’s detox network. Physical movement enhances blood flow and helps eliminate toxins through sweat. Eat a Fibre-Rich Breakfast: Include foods like oats, chia seeds, fresh fruits, or vegetables in your breakfast. Fibre binds to toxins in the digestive tract and aids their removal through stool, while prebiotics in fibre-rich foods nourish gut bacteria, supporting overall detox. Sunlight Exposure: Spend a few minutes in natural sunlight to regulate your circadian rhythm. Early morning sunlight triggers the release of serotonin, which improves mood, and enhances the body’s production of vitamin D - a nutrient essential for liver and immune function.

    "description1": "Groom-to-be Naga Chaitanya recently shared his thoughts on working out and what it means for him. \"For me, fitness is.everyone thinks working out in the gym is all that you have to do, but no! It's 70 percent your diet and 30 percent your workout,\" the Laal Singh Chaddha actor said. In a conversation with CurlyTales, he also shared his morning ritual. \"I drink 500 ml of water,\" he said, adding that his go-to breakfast is \"eggs, peanut butter toast, and filter coffee.\" Following his admission, let's understand why diet plays a crucial role in one's fitness journey. Dr Bhavana P, chief dietitian, Gleneagles Hospitals, Lakdi Ka Pul, Hyderabad, said that a toned body and good fitness are a combination of disciplined lifestyle choices, consistent exercise, and proper nutrition. \"The foundation of a ripped physique is a well-rounded approach that prioritises health and sustainability over quick fixes such that diet has the most important role to play,\" said Dr Bhavana. What is a good diet? A balanced diet is rich in lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. \"Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth, while complex carbohydrates provide the energy needed for intense workouts. Healthy fats, such as those found in avocados and nuts, support overall health and hormone production,\" said Dr Bhavana. Jaya Jyotsna, dietician at Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, Delhi, said t",
    "description2": "hat for optimum fitness levels, it's important to combine a well-balanced diet with an effective fitness routine. *High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): This involves alternating between short bursts of intense activity and rest or low-intensity exercise. It boosts metabolism and burns a lot of calories in a short time. *Strength training: Builds muscle mass, which increases your resting metabolic rate, allowing you to burn more calories even when at rest. *Cardio workouts: Running, cycling, or swimming can help burn calories and improve cardiovascular health. *Consistency and progression: Ensure regular workouts and gradually increase the intensity to avoid plateaus. Dr Bhavana also noted that hydration is crucial for muscle function and recovery, while omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish, reduce inflammation and support muscle growth. \"Including fatty fish like salmon in your diet provides essential proteins and healthy fats, aiding in achieving a ripped physique by promoting lean muscle,\" said Dr Bhavana. Combining these elements with a healthy, balanced diet will enhance weight loss results.

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/seniors-ageing-digestion.jpg",
    "description1": "As we age, various physiological changes occur in our bodies, and the digestive system is no exception. These changes can significantly impact digestive function, leading to discomfort and a reduction in nutrient absorption. According to Kanikka Malhotra, Consultant Dietician &amp; Diabetes Educator, understanding these changes is key to managing age-related digestive issues and maintaining optimal gut health. How ageing impacts digestion This is how your increasing age impacts your stomach and its functions, Malhotra explained: Decline in Gastrointestinal Motility: With age, the muscles in the digestive tract, especially in the intestines, tend to weaken. This leads to slower movement of food through the system, causing constipation or, in some cases, diarrhoea. Reduced muscle tone in the bowel can also contribute to discomfort and sluggish digestion. Reduced Salivary Secretion: Saliva plays a crucial role in breaking down food and lubricating it for easier swallowing. As people age, their salivary secretion decreases, making it harder to chew and swallow food. This can lead to difficulties in digestion and nutrient absorption. Changes in Gastric Acid Production: Older adults often experience a decline in stomach acid production, essential for breaking down food and absorbing nutrients like protein, calcium, and vitamin B12. This decline can cause indigestion, bloating, and gas. Nutrient Malabsorption: With ageing, the surface area of the intestines may decrease, along with the efficiency of nutrient absorption. This can lead to deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamin D, calcium, and iron. Weakened Immune System: A decrease in immune function with age also leaves the digestive system more vulnerable to infections, which can further exacerbate gastrointestinal issues. Bowel Mobility: Th",
    "description2": "e weakening of intestinal muscles can lead to slow bowel movements and constipation. The rhythmic contractions responsible for moving food through the digestive tract become less efficient, further contributing to constipation. In some cases, weakened pelvic floor muscles can result in fecal incontinence, especially in older women, Malhotra said. How to manage age-related digestive changes While ageing brings about unavoidable changes in digestion, there are steps you can take to mitigate these effects and maintain good digestive health. Lifestyle Modifications: Regular Physical Activity: Exercise helps maintain muscle tone in the digestive tract and can stimulate bowel movements, reducing the risk of constipation. Stay Hydrated: Drinking enough water (8-10 glasses a day) is crucial for digestion and bowel health. Manage Stress: Chronic stress can disrupt digestion. Techniques like yoga, deep breathing, and meditation can promote relaxation and improve gut health. Avoid Smoking and Excess Alcohol: These substances can irritate the digestive tract, leading to further digestive issues. Dietary Adjustments: Fibre-Rich Diet: Incorporate fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes to support regular bowel movements. Probiotic Foods: Adding fermented foods like yogurt and kefir can help maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria. Small, Frequent Meals: Eating smaller portions more frequently can prevent bloating and indigestion. Limit Fatty and Spicy Foods: These foods can trigger heartburn and acid reflux, so they should be consumed in moderation. Avoid Excess Caffeine and Carbonated Beverages: These can increase the risk of acid reflux and bloating.

    "description1": "Ahsaas Channa recently opened up about the double standards that women face when it comes to expressing their sexual desires.  In an interview with Hauterrfly, the actor highlighted how society often places excessive importance on male pleasure, celebrating men’s sexual experiences as a form of achievement. “If a woman is saying, ‘I’ve not had sex for a very long time, I’m h**ny’… and they just flip calling her a s**t (sic).” She continued, “Male pleasure ko bohot zyada mahatwa diya jaata hai… ki ‘tu score kiya… arey tujhe sex kyu nahi mill raha hai’ (Male pleasure is given too much importance. like 'you scored. why aren’t you getting sex?'). But if we say the same thing to a woman, then it’s frowned upon… ki arey, aurat kyu sex ke baare mein baat kar rahi hai? (Like, why is a woman talking about sex?)” &nbsp; View this post on Instagram &nbsp; A post shared by HAUTERRFLY | A Fork Media Group Co. (@hauterrfly) This disparity in how male and female sexual behaviour is perceived reflects deeper societal biases that influence how women’s worth is often linked to their sexual history. Why are there such stark double standards? Gurleen Baruah, existential psychotherapist at That Culture Thing, says, “Much of it stems from deeply ingrained societal and cultural narratives. Historically, men were seen as protectors and providers, roles that associated them with dominance, autonomy, and control. Over time, this dominance extended to how their sexual behaviours were viewed.” On the other hand, women were traditionally assigned the role of nurturers, with their worth tied to purity and chastity. Their sexuality was policed under the guise of protection, reinforcing the belief that women’s sexual autonomy needed to be controlled, often by men.  Even today, she admits, these perceptions persist, reinforced by media, cultural conditioning, and outdated beliefs. “Men are often praised for their sexual experiences, which are seen as achievements, while ",
    "description2": "women face judgment and derogatory labels for similar choices. There’s also a lingering notion, rooted in outdated evolutionary psychology, that men are naturally wired to seek variety. At the same time, women are biologically programmed for selectivity and nurturing—ideas that have little scientific grounding yet continue to shape societal attitudes.” Baruah stresses, “The irony is that we no longer live in a world where these traditional roles hold relevance. Women are just as autonomous and capable as men and sexuality should be seen as a personal and equal experience.\" Role of s**t-shaming in perpetuating harmful gender norms around sexuality S**t-shaming is a harmful practice rooted in traditional gender norms and patriarchal values, targeting women who openly discuss or express their sexuality. “By labelling them with derogatory terms like 's**t' or 'wh**e,' society seeks to control their autonomy and confine them to outdated roles of submissiveness and restraint,” highlights Baruah.  This judgment is perpetuated by both men and women, reflecting deep-seated fears about female sexual agency. The psychological toll is profound, Baruah says, often leading to lowered self-esteem, shame, and even behaviors driven by rebellion or a need for validation. Slut-shaming is not about morality; it is a tool of control that undermines women’s worth, autonomy, and equality. Creating a healthier, more supportive environment where women feel comfortable expressing their sexual desires Creating a supportive environment where women can express their sexuality without fear starts with comprehensive sexual education that normalises conversations on consent, equality, and patriarchy from a young age.  Baruah says that addressing patriarchal systems that control women’s sexuality is essential, advocating for autonomy and equality in all spheres. Media, families, and institutions must model positive discussions and celebrate diverse experiences of desire.",

    "description": "Expert explains in detail how these two factors can play crucial roles in male and female infertility",
    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/09/air-noise-1.jpg",
    "description1": "A study published in the BMJ Journal recently has linked exposure to two common environmental factors - air pollution and road traffic noise - to infertility in men and women.   According to the study, long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5) has a significant impact on male fertility, while women, particularly those above the age of 35, are more affected by prolonged exposure to road traffic noise.  Researchers mentioned, “Among men, we observed that exposure to PM2.5 was associated with a higher risk of infertility, with similar sized hazard ratios in the two investigated age groups (30-36.9 and 37-45 years).” It further added, “Among women, noise was associated with a higher risk of infertility in the 35-45 age group, whereas no association was observed in the 30-34.9 age group.” Infertility is already a growing concern globally, with various factors including lifestyle choices, health conditions, and now, environmental factors playing a critical role. This study sheds light on how invisible pollutants can interfere with reproductive health, posing new challenges to both public health and individual well-being. How does exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5) lead to reduced sperm count or impaired sperm quality in men? Dr Suri Raju V, senior consultant urologist at Regal Superspeciality Hospital, Bengaluru, highlights that exposure to PM2.5, tiny particles less than 2.5 micrometres, is increasingly recognised as a significant factor affecting male fertility. These particles, when inhaled, enter the bloodstream and cause harm, primarily by inducing oxidative stress. PM2.5 contains toxic elements like heavy metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). “Excessive ROS can damage sperm DNA, membranes, and impair sperm motility, leading to reduced sperm count and quality. Additionally, PM2.5 can disrupt hormone production, particularly testosterone, further impairing sperm production. It also triggers systemic inflammation, affecting reproductive organs like the testes, contributing to male infertility,” he mentions. Specific biological mechanisms triggered by noise pollution that might lead to infertility in women The link between road traffic noise and infertility, particularly in women over 35, highlights the impact of environmental stress on reproductive health, says Dr Suri Raju. Prolonged noise exposure triggers several biological mechanisms that can affect fertility: Chronic Stress: Continuous noise above 55 decibels activates the stress response, raising cortisol levels, which can disrupt reproductive",
    "description2": " hormones like oestrogen and progesterone. This may lead to irregular menstrual cycles or conditions like anovulation (absence of ovulation) and amenorrhea (absence of menstruation). Sleep Disruption: Noise pollution affects sleep, reducing melatonin levels, which are crucial for ovarian function and fertility. For women over 35, this exacerbates age-related fertility decline. Oxidative Stress and Inflammation: Noise increases oxidative stress and inflammation, potentially harming egg quality and endometrial receptivity. It can also contribute to conditions like endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which impact fertility. Cardiovascular and Metabolic Effects: Noise pollution is linked to hypertension and metabolic disorders, which affect blood flow to reproductive organs and can lead to fertility issues like PCOS. Preventive measures individuals can take to minimise exposure to air pollution and traffic noise With increasing evidence linking environmental pollutants like air pollution and noise to infertility, individuals, particularly those living in urban areas, can take several proactive steps to minimise their exposure, according to Dr Suri Raju: Air Quality Awareness: Staying informed about the air quality in your area is a crucial first step. On days when the air quality is poor, avoid outdoor activities, especially during peak traffic hours when pollution levels are at their highest.  Indoor Air Quality Management: In addition to using air purifiers, regular ventilation and the use of houseplants known for their air-purifying properties, such as snake plants and peace lilies, can help improve indoor air quality. Regularly cleaning and vacuuming with HEPA-filtered devices can also reduce particulate matter buildup indoors. Personal Protective Measures: When exposure to high levels of air pollution is unavoidable, such as during commuting, wearing N95 masks can help filter out PM2.5 particles. Using protective eyewear can also reduce irritation from airborne pollutants, which may indirectly affect overall health and well-being. Noise Reduction Strategies: For those exposed to constant road traffic noise, investing in soundproofing measures at home, such as double-glazed windows, heavy curtains, or soundproof panels, can significantly reduce indoor noise levels. Noise-cancelling headphones or earplugs can be used during sleep or relaxation to minimise noise disturbances.

    "description1": "Union Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari recently revealed his love for the flavourful dish Panch Phoron Dahi Baingan, a recipe that combines the richness of eggplants, the tanginess of curd, and the unique aroma of panch phoron. In an interview with Curly Tales earlier this year, Gadkari revealed that his wife makes delicious aloo vangyachi bhaji, adding, “Aaj kal meri kheti hai Nagpur mein… 18 km dur, apna ghar hai, chef hai. Wahan jaa ke main apne ghar ke organic sabjiyan bharit ke saath vangi ki bhaji sabji banata hu (These days, I have a farm in Nagpur…18 km away, with my own house and a chef. There, I use homegrown organic vegetables to make dishes like vangyache bharit ).” He shared that during a visit to a close friend, he was served a dish he enjoyed so much that he decided to recreate the recipe at home and found it delightful. Gadkari not only shared his enthusiasm for this delicacy but also detailed the recipe: The dish combines a simple cooking process with the complex flavours of panch phoron. Slice the brinjal into round pieces and marinate them with oil, panch phoran, and a pinch of hing. Panch phoran is a blend of cumin seeds (jeera), nigella seeds (kalonji), fenugreek seeds (methi), wild celery seeds (radhuni), and fennel seeds (sauf). Heat a pan, add the marinated brinjal, and fry it lightly on both sides. Be careful not to make it crispy. Then, take some hung curd, ensuring it's not completely drained of water. To the curd, mix in red chilli powder, panch phoran, and salt to taste. Add the spiced curd mixture to the pan with the brinjal and cook it through, ensuring the flavours meld together nicely. Nutritional benefits Kanikka Malhotra, consultant dietician and certified diabetes educator, says, “Eggplants, curd, and panch phoron are the main ingredients in panch phoron dahi baingan, each offering distinct nutritional benefits. Eggplants are low in calories and high in fibre, which aids digestion and helps regulate blood sugar levels. They are rich in antioxidants, particularly nasunin - an anthocyanin found predominantly in the peels of eggplants, which protects cells from damage and may reduce heart disease risk.”  Curd (yoghurt) is a probiotic food that promotes gut health and improves digestion, adds Malhotra. It is also a good source of calcium and phosphorus, essential for bone strength. ",
    "description2": "Panch phoron, a blend of whole spices like cumin and fenugreek, enhances digestion and may help control blood sugar levels while providing anti-inflammatory benefits. “Together, these ingredients create a nutritious dish that supports overall health,” she says. How panch phoron can enhance both the flavour and health quotient of dishes “Panch phoron enhances both flavour and health in dishes like dahi baingan through its unique blend of spices: fenugreek, nigella, cumin, black mustard, and fennel,” notes Malhotra. She mentions, “The aromatic profile of these spices adds depth and complexity to dishes, making them more appealing. The combination creates a warm, earthy taste that complements various ingredients.” “Each spice contributes to health; for instance, cumin aids digestion and reduces bloating, while fenugreek helps regulate blood sugar levels. Additionally, the antioxidant properties of these spices combat oxidative stress, potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases. Thus, panch phoron not only elevates culinary experiences but also promotes overall well-being,” Malhotra states. To ensure proper consistency of hung curd in this recipe, Malhotra suggests allowing the yogurt to drain for at least 4-8 hours in the refrigerator. Overnight is ideal for maximum thickness. “Opt for a fine muslin or cheesecloth to prevent whey from seeping back into the curd, ensuring a smooth texture. Monitor the curd periodically to achieve your desired thickness without over-draining and ensure that the strainer is elevated above the bowl to prevent collected whey from touching the curd, which can make it watery,” she stresses. Variations or substitutions for people who want to adapt the recipe to suit dietary restrictions or preferences Malhotra suggests the following variations:  Dairy-Free: To accommodate lactose intolerance or vegan diets, replace regular yoghurt with plant-based alternatives like almond, coconut, or soy yoghurt. Gluten-Free: Ensure that all spices, including panch phoron, are gluten-free. Avoid adding ingredients containing gluten, such as certain processed foods.  Low-Fat: Use low-fat yogurt or Greek yoghurt to reduce calories while maintaining creaminess. Spice Variations: If panch phoron is unavailable, substitute with a mix of cumin, mustard seeds, and fennel in equal parts for a similar flavour profile.",

    "description1": "A recent outbreak of the Marburg virus, also known as the ‘bleeding eye’ virus, has triggered a global health alert. With at least 15 fatalities and hundreds of infections reported across 17 African countries, including Rwanda, health officials are urging travellers to exercise caution. According to a report by The Independent, “In October the WHO warned against all travel to Rwanda, while the UK's national public health agency warned travellers visiting Rwanda to avoid a host of activities such as participating in burial rituals or coming into contact with wild animals.” Dr Jagadish Hiremath, public health intellectual, tells indianexpress.com, “The 'bleeding eye' virus, officially known as the Marburg virus, is a highly infectious and often fatal virus belonging to the same family as the Ebola virus (Filoviridae). First identified in 1967 during outbreaks in Germany and Yugoslavia linked to laboratory monkeys imported from Uganda, it has since caused sporadic outbreaks in Africa.” What makes it deadly According to Dr Hiremath, “The Marburg virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever, with a mortality rate ranging from 23% to 90%, depending on the outbreak and available healthcare facilities. Death often occurs within 8–9 days of symptom onset, typically due to severe blood loss or multi-organ failure.” Early symptoms include high fever, severe headache, muscle pain, and malaise. As the disease progresses, patients experience vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and significant bleeding (both internal and external). The term ‘bleeding eye virus’ comes from bloodshot or hemorrhaging eyes observed in some cases. Dr Hiremath adds that the virus replicates rapidly, overwhelming the immune system and causing widespread inflammation and vascular damage, leading to shock and organ failure. “Marburg is transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids (blood, saliva, sweat, urine, vomit) of infected individuals or contaminated surfaces. This ease of transmission makes controlling outbreaks extremely challenging,” he notes. Why is it difficult to develop a vaccine or treatment for it? Developing vaccines or treatments for the Marburg virus is challenging due to several factors, says Dr Hiremath, which are: Rarity and Sporadic Outbreaks: The virus occurs in isolated out",
    "description2": "breaks, limiting opportunities for large-scale research and clinical trials. This sporadic nature also reduces pharmaceutical companies' incentives to invest in vaccine development. Complex Pathophysiology: The virus targets multiple organs, causing widespread damage that is difficult to counteract. Its ability to suppress the immune system further complicates treatment. Lack of Established Therapies: Unlike some other viruses, no widely approved antiviral drugs specifically targeting Marburg exist. Research into promising candidates, like monoclonal antibodies and antiviral agents, is ongoing but remains in early stages. Resource Constraints in Affected Areas: Outbreaks often occur in resource-limited regions, making implementing sophisticated treatment protocols or conducting clinical trials challenging. Similar Challenges as Ebola: The Marburg virus shares many characteristics with Ebola, for which vaccines and treatments were only recently developed after decades of research. Marburg's rarity further delays similar progress. How can travellers to affected regions protect themselves? Dr Hiremath suggests avoiding contact with infected individuals or high-risk areas like caves with Rousettus bats and bushmeat sources to prevent viral hemorrhagic fever. Practice strict hygiene by washing hands often and avoiding face-touching. Use protective gear such as masks and gloves, stay informed through WHO and CDC updates, and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms like fever or muscle pain appear after exposure to high-risk environments. Could the Marburg virus outbreak lead to a global health crisis? Dr Hiremath informs that Marburg virus outbreaks are “typically localised and less likely to cause global pandemics” than airborne viruses like COVID-19, but the high fatality rate, human-to-human transmission, and increased global travel pose significant risks. Effective containment relies on rapid diagnosis, isolation, contact tracing, public awareness, international collaboration, and advancing research in diagnostics and treatments to prevent widespread transmission and manage future outbreaks.

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/PwD.jpg",
    "description1": "Gaining the trust and respect of one’s colleagues can be hard. For persons with disabilities (PwDs), it can be especially daunting. But this hasn’t stopped them from climbing the corporate ladder while braving the risk of rejection. Data from recruitment service provider foundit shows that job postings for PwDs have grown 81 per cent in November 2024 compared to the same month last year. Over 50 per cent of these jobs are for PwD with more than 6 years of experience, according to the data. As the world observes International Day of Persons with Disabilities on December 3, The Indian Express spoke to PwDs on how they navigate professional challenges, and manage teams of able-bodied people. 'Getting first job was tougher than expected' Rudolf D’Souza, 62, knows a thing or two about handling rejection. Diagnosed with polio at age 2, D’Souza went on to serve at various corporate houses in physically demanding roles such as sales and knowledge management. It entailed carrying bulky computers as a retail salesperson in one of his first jobs and climbing up to 20 storeys at a construction site to compare manufacturing methods. But getting that first job was tougher than he expected. “I won prizes in college and was adjudged the ‘Best Male Delegate’. But it was the 80s, and after every job interview I sat for, I was told: ‘You are good but you have polio. We can’t hire you.’” He then decided to get an MBA, but the same story repeated. For him, the last straw was when he progressed to the HR round at HCL Computers. “After the round, the HR executive took me aside and told me he had noticed I was limping and was cancelling my selection.” This is when D’Souza took matters into his own hands. Once home, he wrote a letter to Shiv Nadar, the founder of the technology firm, “pouring my heart out, and not expecting a reply”. But he did get a reply. D’Souza was called to the company headquarters a few days later. “The GM of special projects apologised to me, said the conduct of the HR executive wasn’t right, and allowed me to join the selection process. The final round wasn’t a cakewalk but I got selected as a management trainee. In this way, Shiv Nadar gave me my first job,” D’Souza says. After that, he says he didn’t face biases while working. He was, in fact, admired for his work ethic. “When people see your ability, they will stop thinking about your disability,” says D’Souza. Navigating leadership challenges Hari Raghavan agrees. The 47-year-old, who is visually impaired, says effectively navigating leadership challenges comes down to emotional maturity, irrespective of whether or not one has a disability. The lead for Global Strategic Partnership at Amazon Web Services says most people genuinely want to do the right thing, but don’t know how to help. “Since I am comfortable with my disability, that comfort puts others at ease too… I often tell people if I need help and how they can do so.” Besides that, Raghavan says holding oneself to the highest standards and preparing meticulously is important. “I dedicate time each week to ideation and business planning”. Keeping up with the times Mamta Dalal, who works as the content head at Aptech Limited, the global training and education services firm, says she is constantly looking to learn. “My enthusiasm for new technologies or skills hasn't dimmed despite more than 20 years in this industry,” she says. Dalal was diagnosed with acute hearing loss in her 20s after some medicines saved her life but damaged her sensory nerves. “Obviously it was a shock to wake up one day to find my hearing gone”. She has since learned to ask people to clarify things if she feels she has missed parts of a conversation, especially in group settings with multiple speakers. Being upfront about ",
    "description2": "one’s needs is indeed a common theme. Sheetal Bathija, the head of culture at NatWest Group India, has limited mobility and faces issues with maintaining balance. “Walking even short distances can be tiring,” she says. What helps is being “transparent about my challenges but also conscious of my strengths”. The hybrid model of work aids Bathija who needs to collaborate with colleagues both in India and the United Kingdom. She also heads the employee-led inclusion initiative for PwDs at the global banking firm. Bathija says planning is key. Several PwDs concur that planning helps them know in advance if they would need support for a particular activity in the day or the week ahead. Being vocal about one’s needs For those in two minds about making their needs heard at the workplace, Michael Sequeira has one piece of advice: Be bold and take that step. The 41-year-old, who works as a recruiter at UK-based housing and care provider Sanctuary, says one needs to be vocal about their disability. “This also allows companies to help better once they become aware about specific requirements of an employee,” he says. Sequeira, who has restricted eye vision and epilepsy, received the National Award for Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (Low Vision) in 2012 from the then President Pranab Mukherjee. His advice for PwDs looking to change jobs is to research any prospective employer’s treatment of existing employees with disabilities. It helps if the company has an accreditation, such as the UK’s Disability Confident Scheme, which “encourages employers to think about how they can employ” PwDs. Besides this, forming network groups and identifying mentors plays a big role in career advancement, says the IIM Bangalore alum. Bridging the tech gap But like in the case of D’Souza, one of the biggest challenges PwDs face is getting through the first door — the hiring process. “Imagine a visually impaired person trying to navigate a job portal that does not work with screen readers, or a hearing-impaired candidate who is not provided a sign language interpreter during an interview. For many, the process ends before it even begins,” says Shilpi Kapoor, the chief executive officer at digital accessibility and consulting firm BarrierBreak. Kapoor, who is able-bodied, suggests that organisations should start with accessibility audits to find gaps and then fix them systematically. \"Ensure accessibility is provided from the design stage itself,\" she says. Dropping the lens of ‘charity’ But even today, the discourse gets caught in the binary of either feeling pity for PwDs or painting them simply as figures for inspiration. Many people fail to recognise that disability issues require investment and systemic change, rather than being treated as acts of kindness, says Armaan Ali, the executive director of the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People. “The biggest challenge is convincing people, including individuals with disabilities, that disability is a rights-based development issue and not a charity or welfare,” says Ali, who has a locomotor disability and uses a wheelchair. In the end, disability itself is not the impediment; it is the environment. Ali, whose organisation works on cross-disability advocacy, says the focus should be on breaking the “physical, infrastructural, informational, and attitudinal” barriers rather than viewing disability as a limitation. PwDs rising through the ranks and aspiring to take on leadership roles should manage their disability proactively, use assistive technology, and seek support from friends and family. Never feel apologetic about who you are, says Ali. “Focus on your strengths, work on them, and remember that everyone is capable of achieving something remarkable.”",

With the growing focus on high-protein diets, knowing which dals pack the most nutritional punch can help you make informed choices for a healthier plate.

So, while dals contribute substantially to protein intake, they may not suffice alone.” Ranking commonly consumed Indian dals based on their protein content and overall nutritional value Malhotra ranks some commonly consumed Indian dals based on their protein content and overall nutritional value:  Rank Lentil Type Protein Content (per 100g) Key Benefits 1 Urad Dal (Black Gram) 26g Rich in iron and dietary fibre, supports muscle recovery and digestion. 2 Moong Dal (Green Gram) 24g Low in calories, high in potassium and iron, beneficial for weight management. 3 Masoor Dal (Red Lentils) 23g Easy to digest, high in fibre, aids in blood circulation. 4 Chana Dal (Bengal Gram) 13g Rich in minerals like copper and manganese. 5 Toor Dal (Pigeon Pea) 12g High in dietary fibre, promotes digestion and immunity.   Factors that affect the prot",
    "description2": "ein quality and digestibility of dals The protein quality and digestibility of dals are influenced by several factors, according to Malhotra:  Type of Dal: Different dals have varying protein concentrations and amino acid profiles, which affect their overall quality.  -Processing Methods: Soaking and sprouting can enhance protein bioavailability and digestibility by reducing antinutrients.  -Cooking Techniques: Pressure cooking can better preserve protein content than prolonged boiling.  -Complementary Proteins: Combining dals with grains or other legumes can create a complete amino acid profile, improving overall protein quality.  -Storage Conditions: Proper storage prevents nutrient degradation, ensuring better protein retention.  How do dals compare to other plant-based protein sources? Malhotra mentions, “Dals are significant plant-based protein sources, but their protein quality and digestibility vary compared to other options like soybeans or quinoa. For instance, while urad dal offers about 26g of protein per 100g, it lacks some essential amino acids found in animal proteins. Dals generally provide incomplete proteins, meaning they should be combined with grains or other legumes to achieve a complete amino acid profile.” DISCLAIMER: This article is based on information from the public domain and/or the experts we spoke to.

    "description1": "\n\n\nToronto [Canada], December 2 (ANI): A new study by The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and the Institut Curie demonstrates how stem cells sense and adapt to their surroundings, with implications for inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.\nStem cells constantly adapt to their environment to maintain organ and tissue health, informed by chemical signals and physical forces. When they do not function as intended, stem cells can result in a number of health conditions including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal (bowel) cancer, where they continue to divide until a tumour forms.\n\nUntil now, how stem cells sense the physical forces around them has remained unclear, but novel findings in Science led by Dr. Meryem Baghdadi, a former SickKids postdoctoral researcher, Dr Tae-Hee Kim at SickKids and Dr. Danijela Vignjevic at Institut Curie, has revealed that stem cells depend on two ion channels, called PIEZO1 and PIEZO2, for their survival.\n\"The physical properties of the environment around stem cells are crucial to our health,\" explains Kim, Senior Scientist in the Developmental and Stem Cell Biology program. \"With this knowledge, we can explore ways to promote gastrointestinal regeneration to not only prevent, but repair damaged stem cells.\"\nIn 2018, Dr Xi Huang, Senior Scientist in the Developmental and Stem Cell Biology program at SickKids, found that PIEZO ion channels influence tumour stiffening in brain cancer. Inspired by this research, Kim's research team set out to explore how stem cells in the intestines use PIEZO",
    "description2": " channels to stay healthy and function properly.\n\n\nIn a preclinical model, the study team knocked out (turned off) PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 in the intestines. The results were dramatic: in the absence of both PIEZO channels, the stem cells couldn't maintain their necessary functions, leading to severe illness and rapid death. Although these PIEZO channels were previously known to have distinct functions, this study has revealed their unexpected redundancy in stem cell maintenance.\nThe Kim and Vignjevic labs identified that PIEZO ion channels were helping stem cells feel physical changes in their surroundings, like how stiff or stretchy the environment is. Without these channels, there was an imbalance in two critical signalling pathways, causing the stem cells to miss important changes in their environment and improperly differentiate.\n\"When PIEZO channels are missing, stem cells can't stay stem cells. Instead, they turn into other cell types too quickly, leading to serious health problems,\" says Baghdadi.\nThe discovery has significant implications for human health, particularly for conditions with abnormal stem cell activity such as IBD, one of the fastest-growing conditions in Canada, and bowel cancer, the third most common cancer in the country.\n\"More and more we are finding that our cells are more than just biology, there are chemical and mechanical signals which are driving cell activity,\" says Kim. \"How and why our body responds to these signals will open up new doors of research not just for gut health, but for every aspect of human health.\" (ANI)\n",

    "description1": "\n\n\nLausanne [Switzerland], December 2 (ANI): Researchers at EPFL and Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), led by professors Gregoire Courtine and Jocelyne Bloch, have made significant advances in the treatment of spinal cord injuries (SCI). The scientists boosted the recovery of lower limb movements in two people with partial SCI by delivering deep brain stimulation (DBS) to an unanticipated region of the brain--the lateral hypothalamus (LH), considerably increasing their autonomy and well-being.\nWolfgang Jager, a 54-year-old from Kappel, Austria, has been in a wheelchair since 2006 after a ski accident left him with a spinal cord injury. Participating in the clinical trial, he experienced firsthand how deep brain stimulation could restore his mobility and independence. \"Last year on vacation, it was no problem to walk a couple of steps down and back to the sea using the stimulation,\" Jager shared, describing the newfound freedom DBS has given him. Beyond walking, the therapy has improved everyday tasks. \"I can also reach things in my cupboards in the kitchen,\" he added.\n\nDBS is a well-established neurosurgical technique that involves implanting electrodes into specific brain regions to modulate neural activity. Traditionally, DBS has been used to treat movement disorders like Parkinson's disease and essential tremor by targeting areas of the brain responsible for motor control. However, applying DBS to the lateral hypothalamus to treat partial paralysis is a novel approach. By focusing on the LH, the researchers at . Neurorestore tapped into an unexpected neural pathway that had not been considered before for motor recovery.\nIn the study published in Nature Medicine, not only did the DBS show immediate results to augment walking during rehabilitation, but patients also showed long-term improvement that persisted even when the stimulation was turned off. These findings suggest that the treatment promoted a reorganization of residual nerve fibers that contribute to sustained neurological improvements.\n\"This research demonstrates that the brain is needed to recover from paralysis. Surprisingly, the brain is not able to take full advantage of the neuronal projections that survive after a spinal cord injury. Here, we found how to tap into a small region of the brain that was not known to be involved in the production of walking in order to engage these residual connections and augment neurological recovery in people with spinal cord injury,\" says Courtine, professor of neuroscience at EPFL, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) and UNIL and co-director of the .NeuroRestore center.\n\n\nThe success of this DBS therapy h",
    "description2": "inged on two complementary approaches: discoveries enabled by novel methodologies in animal studies and the translation of these discoveries into precise surgical techniques in humans. For the surgery, the researchers used detailed brain scans to guide the precise locations of the small electrodes into the brain, performed by Bloch at CHUV, while the patient was fully awake.\n\"Once the electrode was in place and we performed the stimulation, the first patient immediately said, 'I feel my legs.' When we increased the stimulation, she said, 'I feel the urge to walk!' This real-time feedback confirmed we had targeted the correct region, even if this region had never been associated with the control of the legs in humans. At this moment, I knew that we were witnessing an important discovery for the anatomical organization of brain functions,\" says Bloch, neurosurgeon and professor at the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), UNIL and EPFL, and co-director of the .NeuroRestore centre.\nThe identification of the LH as a key player in motor recovery after paralysis is in itself an important scientific discovery, given that this region has traditionally only been associated with functions like arousal and feeding. This breakthrough emerged from the development of a novel multi-step methodology that began with whole-brain anatomical and functional mapping to establish the role of this region in walking, followed by experiments in preclinical models to establish the precise circuits involved in the recovery. Ultimately, these results led to clinical trials in human participants.\n\"It was fundamental research, through the creation of detailed brain-wide maps, that allowed us to identify the lateral hypothalamus in the recovery of walking. Without this foundational work, we would not have uncovered the unexpected role this region plays in walking recovery,\" says Jordan Squair, a lead author of the study.\nThe advanced imaging platform at the Wyss Center played a critical role in this research by providing high-resolution imaging capabilities that enabled the team to map the anatomical and functional activity of neurons across the brain, enabling the identification of the lateral hypothalamus.\nThese remarkable results pave the way for new therapeutic applications to augment recovery from SCI. Future research will explore integrating DBS with other technologies, such as spinal implants that have already shown their potential in restoring movement after SCI. \"Integrating our two approaches--brain and spinal stimulation--will offer a more comprehensive recovery strategy for patients with spinal cord injuries,\" says Courtine.

    "description1": "\n\n\nLausanne [Switzerland], November 27 (ANI): As we age, our cognitive and motor functions degrade, reducing our independence and overall quality of life. Research efforts to mitigate or perhaps eliminate this have resulted in technologies that hold a lot of promise.\nNow, scientists led by Friedhelm Hummel at EPFL have identified an important factor affecting an individual's responsiveness to atDCS. The team looked at how native learning abilities determine the effect of brain stimulation applied while learning a motor task. Their findings suggest that individuals with less efficient learning mechanisms benefit more from stimulation, while those with optimal learning strategies might experience negative effects.\n\nAmong these is non-invasive brain stimulation: a term encompassing a set of techniques that can affect brain functions externally and noninvasively, without the need for surgery or implants. One such promising technique, in particular, is anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS), which uses a constant, low electrical current delivered via electrodes on the scalp to modulate neuronal activity.\nHowever, studies exploring atDCS have produced inconsistent results, which has prompted researchers to explore why some people benefit from atDCS while others don't. The problem seems to lie in our understanding of factors that may influence responsiveness to brain stimulation, leading to responders and non-responders; among these, age has been suggested as one important factor.\nSome studies suggest further factors such as baseline behavioural abilities and previous training might be important considerations, but an interplay of these factors with behaviour has not been determined in detail, pointing to the need of refined predictive models of the effects of atDCS.\nThe researchers recruited 40 participants: 20 middle-aged adults (50-65 years old) and 20 older adults (over 65). Each group was further divided into those receiving active atDCS and those receiving placebo stimulation.\n\n\nOver ten days, participants practised a finger-tapping task designed to study motor sequence learning at home while receiving atDCS. The task involved replicating a numerical sequence using a keypad, trying to",
    "description2": " be as fast and as accurate as possible.\nThe team then used a machine-learning model trained on a public dataset to classify participants as either \"optimal\" or \"suboptimal\" learners, based on their initial performance. This model aimed to predict who would benefit from atDCS, based on their ability to integrate information about the task efficiently early during training\nThe study found that suboptimal learners, who were seemingly less efficient at internalizing the task at the early stages of learning, experienced an accelerated accuracy improvement while performing the task when receiving atDCS. This effect was not limited to people of a certain age (e.g., older adults), with suboptimal learners being found among younger individuals as well.\nIn contrast, participants with optimal learning strategies, regardless of age, even showed a negative trend in performance when receiving atDCS. This difference suggests that brain stimulation is more beneficial for individuals who initially struggle with motor tasks. As such, atDCS seems to possess a restorative rather than an enhancing quality, with important implications for rehabilitation.\n\"By leveraging different methods in Machine learning, we were able to untangle the influence of different factors on the individual effects of brain stimulation,\" said Pablo Maceira, the study's first author. \"This will pave the way to maximize the effects of brain stimulation in individual subjects and patients.\"\nThe study implies that, in the long run, personalized brain stimulation protocols will be developed to maximize benefits based on an individual's specific needs, rather than a common trait such as age. This approach could lead to more effective brain stimulation-based interventions, targeting specific mechanisms supporting learning, especially in the view of neurorehabilitation, for which the main basis is the re-learning of lost skills due to a brain lesion (e.g., after a stroke or a traumatic brain injury).\n\"In the future, clinicians could apply a more advanced version of our algorithm to determine whether a patient will benefit from a brain stimulation-based therapy, to enhance the effects of neurorehabilitation and personalize treatment,\" said Hummel.(ANI)\n",

    "description1": "\n\n\nNew York [US], November 26 (ANI): Laboratory experiments with cancer cells reveal two ways in which tumors evade drugs designed to starve and kill them, a new study shows. While chemotherapy successfully treats tumours and extends patients' lives, it is known that they do not work for everyone for long, since cancer cells rewire the mechanism by which they transform fuel into energy (metabolism) in order to avoid the treatments' effects. Many of these medications are so-called antimetabolics, which disrupt cell processes necessary for tumour growth and survival.\nLed by researchers at NYU Langone Health and its Perlmutter Cancer Center, the new study shows how cancer cells survive in an environment made hostile by the persistent shortage of the energy from glucose (the chemical term for blood sugar) needed to drive tumor growth. This better understanding of how cancer cells evade the drugs' attempts to kill them in a low-glucose environment, the researchers say, could lead to the design of better or more effective combination therapies.\n\nThree such drugs used in the study -- raltitrexed, N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA), and brequinar -- work to prevent cancer cells from making pyrimidines, molecules that are an essential component to genetic letter codes, or nucleotides, that make up RNA and DNA. Cancer cells must have access to pyrimidine supplies to produce more cancer cells and to produce uridine nucleotides, a primary fuel source for cancer cells as they rapidly reproduce, grow, and die. Disrupting the fast-paced but fragile pyrimidine synthesis pathways, as some chemotherapies are designed to do, can rapidly starve cancer cells and spontaneously lead to them dying (apoptosis).\nStudy results showed that the low-glucose environment inhabited by cancer cells, or tumor microenvironment, stalls cancer cell consumption of existing uridine nucleotide stores, making the chemotherapies less effective.\nNormally, uridine nucleotides would be made and consumed to help make the genetic letter codes and fuel cell metabolism. But when DNA and RNA construction is blocked by these chemotherapies, so too is the consumption of uridine nucleotide pools, the researchers found, as glucose is needed to change one form of uridine, UTP, into another usable form, UDP-glucose. The irony, researchers say, is that a low-glucose tumor microenvironment is in turn slowing down cellular consumption of uridine nucleotides and presumably slowing down rates of cell death. Researchers say cancer cells need to run out of pyrimidine building blocks, including uridine nucleotides, before the cells will self-destruct.\n\n\nIn other experiments, low-glucose tumor microenvironments were al",
    "description2": "so unable to activate two proteins, BAX and BAK, sitting on the surface of mitochondria, a cell's fuel generator. Activation of these trigger proteins disintegrates the mitochondria, and instantly sets off a series of caspase enzymes that help initiate apoptosis (cell death).\n\"Our study shows how cancer cells manage to offset the impact of low-glucose tumor microenvironments, and how these changes in cancer cell metabolism minimize chemotherapy's effectiveness,\" said study lead investigator Minwoo Nam, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Pathology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and Perlmutter Cancer Center.\n\"Our results explain what has until now been unclear about how the altered metabolism of the tumor microenvironment impacts chemotherapy: low glucose slows down the consumption and exhaustion of uridine nucleotides needed to fuel cancer cell growth and hinders resulting apoptosis, or death, in cancer cells,\" said senior study investigator Richard Possemato, PhD. Possemato is an associate professor in the Department of Pathology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and also a member of Perlmutter Cancer Center.\nPossemato, who is also coleader of the Cancer Cell Biology Program at Perlmutter, says his team's study results could one day be used to develop chemotherapies or combination therapies that would change or trick cancer cells into responding the same way in a low-glucose microenvironment as they would in an otherwise stable glucose microenvironment.\nHe also says that diagnostic tests could be developed to measure how a patient's cancer cells would most likely respond to low-glucose microenvironments and to predict how well a patient might respond to a particular chemotherapy.\nPossemato says his team has plans to investigate how blocking other cancer cell pathways might trigger apoptosis in response to these chemotherapies. Some experimental drugs, such as Chk-1 and ATR inhibitors, already exist that might accomplish this, he notes, but more need to be investigated because Chk-1 and ATR inhibitors are not well tolerated by patients.\nFor the study, researchers performed a scan of 3,000 cancer cell genes known to be involved in cell metabolism to determine, by deletion, which were necessary for cancer cell survival after chemotherapy. Most of the genes they found that were essential to cell survival in low-glucose tumor environments were also involved in pyrimidine synthesis, a precise biological pathway targeted by many chemotherapies. This focused their experiments on how different lab-grown clones of cancer cells responded to low-glucose after chemotherapy and what other chemical processes were impacted by depressed sugar levels.

    "description1": "\n\n\nToronto [Canada], November 15 (ANI): Researchers at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) revealed that stress alters how our brain encodes and retrieves aversive memories, and they developed a potential new method for restoring adequate memory specificity in persons suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nIf you stumble during a presentation, you might feel stressed the next time you have to present because your brain associates your next presentation with that one poor and aversive experience. This type of stress is tied to one memory. But stress from traumatic events like violence or generalized anxiety disorder can spread far beyond the original event, known as stress-induced aversive memory generalization, where fireworks or car backfires can trigger seemingly unrelated fearful memories and derail your entire day. In the case of PTSD, it can cause much greater negative consequences.\n\nIn a study published in Cell, Drs. Sheena Josselyn and Paul Frankland, Senior Scientists in the Neurosciences & Mental Health program, identify the biological processes behind stress-induced aversive memory generalization and highlight an intervention which could help restore appropriate memory specificity for people with PTSD.\n\"A little bit of stress is good, it's what gets you up in the morning when your alarm goes off, but too much stress can be debilitating,\" says Josselyn, who holds a Canada Research Chair in Circuit Basis of Memory. \"We know that people with PTSD show fearful responses to safe situations or environments, and have found a way to limit this fearful response to specific situations and potentially reduce the harmful effects of PTSD.\"\nTogether with their colleague Dr. Matthew Hill at the University of Calgary Hotchkiss Brain Institute, the research team was able to block endocannabinoid receptors on interneurons, and limit stress-induced aversive memory generalization to the specific, appropriate memory.\n\n\nIn a preclinical model, the research team exposed subjects to an acute, but safe, stress before an aversive event to create a non-specific fearful memory that could be triggered by unrelated safe situations, similar to how PTSD presents in humans.\nThe team then examined the subject's ",
    "description2": "memory engrams, which are physical representations of a memory in the brain pioneered by the Josselyn and Frankland labs at SickKids. Usually, engrams are made up of a sparse number of neurons, but the stress-induced memory engrams involved significantly more neurons. These larger engrams produced generalized fearful memories that were retrieved even in safe situations.\nWhen they looked closer at these large engrams, the study found that stress caused an increase in the release of endocannabinoids (endogenous cannabinoids) which disrupted the function of interneurons, whose role is it to constrain the size of the engram.\nThe endocannabinoid system enhances memory formation and helps link lived experiences with specific behavioural outcomes. In the amygdala, the emotional processing centre of the brain, certain 'gate keeper' interneurons have special receptors for endocannabinoids, and help constrain the size of the engram and the specificity of the memory. But, when too many endocannabinoids are released, the function of the gatekeeping interneurons is disrupted, causing an increase in the size of the engram.\n\"Endocannabinoid receptors function like a velvet rope at an exclusive club. When stress induces the release of too many endocannabinoids, the velvet rope falls, causing more generalized aversive fearful memories to form,\" explains Josselyn. \"By blocking these endocannabinoid receptors just on these specific interneurons, we could essentially prevent one of the most debilitating symptoms of PTSD.\"\nIn 2023, previous research in Science identified larger, more generalized memory engrams in the developing brain than in the adult brain, just like stress-induced memory engrams. As they continue to explore this unexpected link between engram size, stress and age, the teams are also delving into how daily stressors may impact happy memories.\n\"The many biological functions and processes that make up the complexity of human memory are still being uncovered,\" says Frankland, who holds a Canada Research Chair in Cognitive Neurobiology. \"We hope that as we better understand human memory, we can inform real-world therapies for those with various psychiatric and other brain disorders throughout their lifespan.\" (ANI)\n",

    "description1": "\n\n\nUppsala [Sweden], November 11 (ANI): Researchers at Uppsala University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology have created an antibody that has the potential to treat a variety of cancers. Researchers were able to integrate three different functionalities in the antibody, which combined significantly increased the action of T cells on the cancer tumour.\nResearchers have developed a unique type of antibody that both targets and delivers a drug package via the antibody itself, while simultaneously activating the immune system (\"3-in-1 design\") for personalised immunotherapy treatments.\n\n\"We have been researching precision medicine for close to 15 years now, as well as how we can use antibodies to influence an important key protein (CD40) in the immune system. We can now show that our new antibody method works as precision medicine for cancer,\" explains Sara Mangsbo, professor at the Department of Pharmacy at Uppsala University, who together with Johan Rockberg, professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, is the study's lead author.\n\n\nThe drug redirects the immune system to find and target specific mutations and gene changes that are only found in cancer cells, known as neoantigens. This is achieved by the new antibody both delivering the unique tumour-specific material directly to a particular type of immune cell and by stimulating this cell simultaneously, which then has the capacity to greatly enhance the T-cell response to the tumour.\nThe results show that the method works in several ways",
    "description2": ". Not only does it activate the right type of immune cells in human blood samples, but animal models show that mice receiving the treatment had prolonged survival and, at higher doses, also save the mice from cancer, and that the method is safer than previous cancer treatments the researchers have studied.\nCustomised precision medicines can be both costly and time-consuming to develop.\n\"The advantage of our drug is that it is easy to produce on a larger scale , yet can be easily tailored to the patient's disease or specific tumour. The medicine consists of two parts that are combined, a targeting bispecific antibody - which can be produced in large quantities in advance - and a custom peptide part, which is produced rapidly synthetically on a small scale for a desired type of cancer. Both in terms of production cost and the short time it takes to tailor a peptide to a new tumour, this increases availability and should make it quicker for patients to go from diagnosis to treatment,\" explains Johan Rockberg, Professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.\nThe aim of the study was to establish a more flexible, faster and safer treatment for cancer than those currently available. The study has already shown that the method has the potential to be customised for each patient, thereby strengthening the immune system against cancer. The next step is to use the fully optimised production process to manufacture the drug candidate for further safety studies and then start clinical trials in humans. (ANI)\n",

    "description1": "Walking is one of the most effective and simplest forms of exercise for one to do. It can improve your overall health, boost your mood, and help maintain a healthy weight. However, many people overlook a crucial aspect of walking, the movement of their hands. Engaging your hand while walking not only enhances your workout but also contributes to better posture and overall fitness. 115929508Also read: Which time is the best for a morning walk?Role of arm and hand movement while walkingAs you walk, your legs surely get great exercise. Do you realize that your arms are probably playing a major part in your activity? The natural swinging of your arms helps to balance your body and can even make walking more efficient. Swinging your arms while you walk reduces the energy that goes into creating movement, making it an efficient workout or movement.If you try to walk without swinging your arms or swinging them in an unnatural manner, for example, swinging the left arm with the left leg you'll immediately discover how clumsy and tiring it feels. The correct technique involves letting your arms swing naturally from the shoulders, moving forward with one arm as the opposite leg steps forward. This not only aids balance but provides a more stronger stride.How to improve your walking technique?Improving your walking technique can give you better fitness results, especially if you want to lose weight or increase your stamina.

Adding simple hand exercises during your walk can enhance circulation and improve coordination.What is the proper way to move your hands while walking?Incorporating hand exercises into your walking routine is not only feasible but also beneficial for overall fitness. Here are some easy hand exercises you can perform while on the move:Fist clenches: Alternate clenching your fists tightly and opening them wide. This exercise improves grip strength and reduces stiffness.Finger taps: Tap each finger to the thumb in succession from index to pinky and then back. This will help in dexterity and will engage fine motor muscles.Wrist rotations: Hold your arms slightly out and rotate your wrists in circles, first clockwise and then counterclockwise. This helps reduce tension and improve flexibility in the wrists.Finger spreads: Spread fingers as far apart as possible and bring them back together. This improves finger flexibility and prevents stiffness at the joints.Thumb extensions: Stretch your thumb outward as far as possible, then fold it across your palm toward the base of your pinky. This strengthens thumb muscles and improves grip. 115929565By combining these hand exercises with walking, you create a holistic workout that engages multiple parts of your body at once. This not only improves circulation but also adds an upper-body workout component, making each walk more effective. 115444718",

    "description1": "Did you know your blood group can reveal more than just your donation compatibility? Various studies suggest that blood type can influence your predisposition to certain diseases. While it’s not a diagnosis, understanding these tendencies can help us make proactive health choices. Through a study done in 2021 has made it apparent that ABO blood types are not the direct cause of diseases, although they can be susceptible to disease and health concerns. Here’s a closer look at how your blood group impacts your health.How blood groups influence health risksYour blood type—A, B, AB, or O—is determined by the presence or absence of specific antigens on red blood cells. These antigens not only determine compatibility for blood transfusions but also interact with your immune system and microbiome. This interaction can influence susceptibility to certain diseases.For example, Type A and B individuals may have a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases like coronary heart disease, while Type O is often associated with lower cholesterol but an increased risk of ulcers. This link isn’t deterministic but serves as a useful indicator of potential vulnerabilities. 115929174Why blood type mattersThe mechanism lies in how antigens influence biological processes. Blood group antigens act like markers that signal to your immune system. They can affect how the body responds to infections, inflammation, and even blood clotting.Type A and cardiovascular disease: People with Type A blood tend to have higher levels of von Willebrand factor, a protein that aids blood clotting. While helpful in stopping bleeding, excess amounts can increase the risk of heart attack or stroke.Type O and ulcers: Type O individuals often have higher levels of stomach acid, making t",
    "description2": "hem more prone to ulcers.This interaction between blood group antigens and bodily processes is an emerging field that continues to unravel fascinating insights.Diseases associated with each blood groupAs per the 2021 study published in the National Library of Medicine, non-O blood types are more susceptible to diseases than O. Here’s a breakdown of common diseases linked to each blood type:Type A: Higher risk of coronary heart disease, gastric cancer, and certain types of infections like smallpox.Type B: Associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes and some autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.Type AB: Higher risk of memory problems and cognitive decline, probably as a result of inadequate blood flow to the brain.Type O: Increased risk of peptic ulcers and blood disorders but decreased risk of heart disease. 115929162Even if there are certain relationships, it does not imply that we are immune to diseases that are not related to our blood type. In terms of general health, lifestyle factors like nutrition, exercise, and stress reduction are far more important.What we can do today to stay healthyKnowing the blood type can help us identify health concerns, but it is not an alternative to medical advice. Use this information as a supplement to regular checkups and a healthy lifestyle. Here are some general tips:If you don’t know your blood type, a simple blood test can provide this crucial piece of information.Adopt habits that reduce overall disease risk, such as maintaining a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking or excessive alcohol consumption.Though controversial, some research suggests that blood-type-specific diets may help optimize health. Consult a professional before making drastic changes.",

    "description1": "Oil plays a central role in maintaining overall health and is mostly linked directly with heart health. When it comes to maintaining a healthy heart, most people think of changing their cooking oil first. The oil that we consume can have a beneficial effect or a detrimental effect on the body depending on its properties.Among the various cooking oils available, olive oil and mustard oil stand out for their potential cardiovascular benefits. Both oils have unique nutritional properties, but their suitability for heart health depends on their composition, the type of cuisine, and how they are used.115472933 Olive oil has anti-inflammatory propertiesOlive oil is extracted from olives and is a staple in Mediterranean cuisine. It is renowned for being rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), particularly oleic acid, which is known to lower bad cholesterol (LDL) levels while maintaining or even boosting good cholesterol (HDL). Olive oil also contains powerful antioxidants like polyphenols and vitamin E, which help reduce inflammation, a critical factor in heart disease.Olive oil linked to low amounts of bad cholesterol in bloodResearchers from the University of Florida found that following a extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) diet resulted in lowered amounts of ‘bad’ cholesterol in the bloodstream. The study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that dietary changes resulted in lower cardiovascular risk factors compared with baseline levels, with a greater difference in optimal directions following the transition to",
    "description2": " a low EVOO diet, suggesting that EVOO may not be the beneficial additive of a Mediterranean Diet. 115215721Mustard oil has fatty acids that can prevent blood clotsMustard oil, derived from mustard seeds, is commonly used in Indian cooking. It has a distinctive pungent flavor and is rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, as well as omega-6 fatty acids. These essential fatty acids are vital for reducing triglycerides and preventing blood clots, which can lower the risk of heart disease. Mustard oil also contains natural antioxidants and exhibits anti-inflammatory properties.Another notable feature of mustard oil is its high smoke point, making it suitable for high-temperature cooking methods like frying, which are prevalent in Indian cuisine. However, mustard oil contains erucic acid, which, in excessive amounts, has been debated for its potential adverse health effects. The presence of erucic acid in mustard oil has raised concerns regarding its cardiovascular safety, prompting regulatory scrutiny and public debate.Which one of these oils is heart-friendly?The best source for those seeking better heart health benefits is olive oil. It is suitable for low heat, cooking as it can be used for dressings and dips or even as a simple addition to a Mediterranean-style diet. Meanwhile, mustard oil holds cultural relevance and practicality for households in India as it has a high smoke point and is suitable for Indian cooking. It affords unique benefits, particularly to those who consume traditional Indian diets.ReplyForward",

    "description1": "Caring for a child is only one aspect of parenting; another involves creating deep emotional bonds and guiding them in developing into kind, self-assured adults. Parents may build a stronger relationship with their children, have meaningful conversations, and gain insight into their inner world by asking them meaningful questions every day. Here are six unique and powerful questions every parent should ask their child daily to foster emotional intelligence and mutual understanding. What is one kind thing you did for someone today?Teaching kindness starts with recognizing and celebrating small acts of generosity. By asking this query, parents inspire the kids to consider their behaviour and discover satisfaction in lending a hand to others. Also, it could inspire individuals to practise compassion more consistently. What is something new you discovered or found interesting today?Children spend their days studying and exploring because they are naturally curious. Whether it's an interesting fact they discovered in school, an original thought they had, or something they noticed, this question invites kids to share their experiences. It keeps you active in their intellectual development and develops their love of learning.  115837872Did anything puzzle you or make you feel ",

    "description1": "No matter how stressful your corporate day job is, or how much your business makes you want to scratch your forehead during dire hours – parenting, many believe, is the trickiest of them all! The job that’s somewhat based on instincts, your intuitions, and gut feelings, and is largely about double, sometimes triple checking every single decision you make about your kid – is bound to take a toll on parents sometimes. However, the key to ace parenting, is to keep calm and carry one while you unlearn and learn!What is parenting?Parenting is the process of nurturing, protecting, and guiding a child from infancy to adulthood. It involves supporting a child's physical, cognitive, social, emotional, and educational development. Parenting can also refer to the care of a child by a caregiver or guardian, not just a biological parent.What is lighthouse parenting?Economist and parenting author Emily Oster, on a recent broadcast of ‘CBS Mornings Plus’, described a specific parenting style, called ‘lighthouse parenting’. She said, while urging the parents, “You’re the lighthouse. You’re guiding them, you’re showing them where the rocks are, but you’re giving them some independence. And it’s something between, you’re driving the boat for them, which is too involved, or you’re just letting them crash into the rocks, which is not recommended.”Psychologist Cara Damiano Goodwin explained to HuffPost, that, a parent who is acting like a lighthouse “points out the dangers in their children’s environments but ultimately lets their child steer their own boat.”As per Goodwin, examples of this parenting style include “giving your child strategies for remembering their homework, but not bringing it to school for them if they forget,” and “allowing them to figure out a compromise with their sibling on their own, rather than serving as a referee for sibling fights.” 115815324Dr. Ken Ginsburg, the founder and program director of the Center for Parent and Teen Communication and a professor of pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told HuffPost, “The term ‘lighthouse parenting’ is a metaphor to explain what we know works. What young people need, is both to be guided and for us to have appropriate boundaries to keep them safe.” Talking more the “reliable” style of parenting, he added, “We should trust that kids are going to learn to navigate the world on their own, but at the same time, we have to protect them.”Does lighthouse parenting help raise confident kids?While all kids need both guidance and autonomy, teens in particular are eager to navigate the world on their own. Lighthouse parenting ",
    "description2": "describes a way for parents to remain an influential presence in teens’ lives without hindering the independence we want them to achieve.As per Goodwin, “We need to show them that we have confidence and trust in them so that they can develop self-confidence. They also need to be allowed the chance to fail and make mistakes while they are still somewhat supported by their parents. Otherwise, they may fall apart when they fail for the first time as an adult out on their own.”For example, If your kid doesn’t finish their homework, instead of doing it for them (or hounding them endlessly about it), you, as a parent, might stand back, allowing them to experience the consequences of missing an assignment — which could motivate them to behave differently next time.As per Ginsburg, teens want to know that they are loved. At the same time, “they don’t want people to demand or to dictate,” he said. “They want guides.”Key points of lighthouse parenting: While lighthouse parenting is not a \"one size fits all\" approach, many children benefit from the parenting style depending on their needs and environment. The key points about the lighthouse parenting are:Balancing guidance and boundaries: Lighthouse parents provide guidance and set boundaries, while also allowing children to learn from their mistakes and navigate their own experiences. 115815381Encouraging independence: Lighthouse parents trust their children to make good decisions and follow the rules, which encourages independence.Providing emotional support: Lighthouse parents offer consistent emotional support while encouraging children to face challenges and solve their own problems.Celebrating successes: Lighthouse parents acknowledge and celebrate their children's achievements, which can boost their self-esteem and motivation.Focus on values over rules: Here, the emphasis is on instilling core values like responsibility, empathy, and resilience in children rather than forcing them to follow rules.Lead the way: Instead of telling the children how to be, lead them. Don’t show them the example, be the example. Show them how to handle stress, conflict, and relationships positively. Helping children learn from failures: Lighthouse parents help children learn from their mistakes, which can help them develop a growth mindset.Building a relationship: Lighthouse parenting can help build a relationship between parent and child.Some benefits of lighthouse parenting include: Healthy boundaries, Developing coping skills, Learning essential life skills like confidence and independence, and Gaining the courage to confront obstacles head-on. 102164741",

    "description1": "When we think about mastering a new skill— whether it’s playing a musical instrument, learning a language, or perfecting a dance move—most of us focus on repetition. Practice makes one perfect, right? Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman sheds light on something even more fascinating: the power of pauses in supercharging our learning process.  The secret in the pause Recent research highlights that brief pauses during practice are far more than just breaks— they’re integral to the learning process. Gap effects research has identified that resting for just 10 seconds while practising a skill allows your brain to replay and reinforce what you’ve just learned  Here’s the astonishing part: During these short pauses, your brain doesn’t just sit idle. Instead, it replays the skill you’ve been practising at lightning speed— 20 to 30 times faster than normal— and often in reverse. It’s like your brain is rewinding and reviewing your actions to strengthen the connections needed to perform them better.  Practicing without practising Imagine you’re learning a new piano piece or perfecting your tennis serve. After a few repetitions, you stop for a quick break. During this pause, your brain's neurons fire rapidly, mimicking the action you were practising. This neural replay reinforces the skill, essentially letting you practice without actively moving. Neural recordings show that during these rest periods, your brain becomes highly active, refining your skills and improving your ",
    "description2": "learning, so your next attempt is even stronger.  Why does this work? The replay and consolidation of the information by the brain during rest is the basic concept through which we learn. When we repeat a skill without pausing, our neurons may not have enough time to process and solidify the information but once breaks are introduced, there is a chance for the rearrangement and strengthening of those neural pathways related to a particular skill.  It’s like building a strong foundation: practising creates the bricks, but pausing allows your brain to cement them into place.  How to use this insight - If you’re working on mastering something new, here’s how to apply this brain hack: - Practice in small chunks: Focus on the skill for a few minutes. - Take short breaks: Pause for 10 to 15 seconds of complete rest. Let your brain do its work. - Repeat: Alternate between practice and rest. This works for anything, from studying to actual sports, helping you progress faster while reducing fatigue. The big picture The insight of how the brain learns changes our approach to the skill-building process and practice. The discovery reveals that sometimes the most important work is to do nothing. By allowing your brain to optimize its processes during short breaks, you’re not only learning smarter but also paving the way for long-term mastery.  So, the next time you’re practising, remember: pausing isn’t slacking— it’s part of the strategy.13700391115593148104441185115427749 ",

    "description1": "As the year ends, December is the perfect time to reflect, reconnect, and build stronger relationships. Whether it’s with your partner, family, friends, or even yourself, the holiday season is a time to nurture bonds and express gratitude. But building better relationships requires more than grand gestures—it’s about small, intentional actions that show you care. This December, take the time to invest in your connections with these thoughtful ideas.1. Organise a personal \"gratitude gathering\" Invite your loved ones for a cosy evening where everyone shares what they appreciate about one another. Create a warm ambience, with candles, soft music, and their favourite comfort food. This activity fosters emotional closeness and makes everyone feel valued and loved. 2. Plan a \"digital detox day\" togetherChoose a day to set aside phones, laptops, and screens. Spend time engaging in meaningful offline activities like baking, board games, or simply talking. A digital detox allows you to be fully present, creating deeper connections free from distractions.  3. Exchange \"memory gifts\"  115936342Instead of material presents, exchange handwritten letters, photo albums, or DIY crafts that mark shared memories. These personalized tokens of affection hold more meaning than expensive, store-bought gifts and create lifelong emotional connections.  4. Create a \"relationship\" bucket listSit down with your partner, family, or friends and brainstorm experiences you’d like to share together in the coming year. Whether it’s travelling to a dream destination, learning a new skill, or volunteering, this activity sparks excitement and strengthens your bond through shared goals.   1159225405. Volunteer togetherVolunteer for a day in a local charity or community centre. Acts of kindness not only benefit others but also help deepen your rel",
    "description2": "ationships by giving you a sense of shared purpose and compassion.  6. Cook family recipes together 115936372Prepare some cherished family recipes with family members to connect to roots. Engaging in shared activities helps strengthen bonds by creating joyful moments together and often brings back memories of childhood days at home.7. Start a \"12 days of thoughtfulness\" challengeFor 12 days, surprise your loved ones with small acts of kindness, such as leaving notes of appreciation, preparing breakfast, or planning mini-surprises. It's a simple yet effective way to show consistent love and care. 1158810708. Take a winter walk and reflectTake a relaxing winter walk with your partner or family. Use this time to discuss your favourite and cherished memories of the past year and hopes for the present. Walking side by side encourages open and heartfelt conversations. 9. Reconnect with long-lost friends  115936386Reach out to old friends with whom you’ve lost touch. A warm message, a phone call, or even an unexpected visit can revive the connection and bring back the happiness those relationships once brought. 10. Set a \"resolution together\" ritualAs the year ends, make it a tradition to set at least one resolution together. It could be as simple as dedicating more time to each other or starting a new hobby as a team. Pursuing a common goal builds a sense of teamwork and deepens the bond between individuals.  115904650December is a time to pause, reflect, and nurture the relationships that matter most. Through thoughtful gestures and meaningful activities, you can strengthen your bonds in lasting ways. There’s no need for grand plans—simple, intentional acts can make the most impact. As you step into the new year, let these efforts serve as a foundation for deeper, more fulfilling connections in the future. 115899805",

    "description1": "When it comes to relationships in modern times, new trends often emerge, reflecting how people are dating and connecting. For instance, these days a new dating term called 'Affordating' is much being talked about by Gen Z and millennials. But what is affordating and how is it shaping the dating world? Read on to know all about it here.Affordating is being upfront about finances in dating. Instead of hiding or exaggerating your money situation, you talk openly about budgets and priorities from the start. It’s about reducing the pressure of expensive dates and creating genuine connections without pretending to be someone you’re not. By setting realistic expectations, affordating makes dating less stressful and more authentic, so both people can focus on enjoying each other’s company without breaking the bank. Benefits of affordating 115945498Affordating offers several advantages. It helps set realistic expectations from the start, allowing both partners to avoid financial stress and misunderstandings. By addressing money matters early on, affordating helps in building trust, reduces anxiety, and also facilitates true connections. This open approach removes the pressures of societal norms that often make people feel the need to impress their date with expensive gestures. 115901788Financial boundaries and respectAffordating focuses on having honest conversations about finances in a relationship. Both partners talk openly about their budgets—whether for dates, gifts, or activities—to keep things fair and stress-free. Instead of feeling pressured to spend more than they can a",
    "description2": "fford, both people respect each other's financial comfort zones. This approach helps build trust and keeps the relationship healthier by focusing on genuine connection rather than financial expectations. It's a simple, honest way to enjoy dating without unnecessary money worries.   115733675Shift in dating culture 115945509Affordating challenges the traditional notion that romance must involve lavish outings or expensive gifts. Instead, it encourages couples to focus on meaningful connections. This approach to dating involves sharing experiences rather than spending money. Cooking at home, a walk in nature, or participating in free local events will most likely make the pair come closer emotionally than focusing on material wealth.  Inclusive and stress-free dating 115945523If you’re on a budget or dealing with student loans, affordating keeps dating low-key and relaxed. It takes away the pressure to splurge on pricey dinners or fancy gifts, making things feel less awkward about money. Instead, it’s all about being real about your finances and connecting without judgment. This way, you can have fun, enjoy the experience, and build a relationship that isn’t tied to who can spend more. 115782342And so, affordating changes the dating game by focusing on understanding and respecting each other's financial boundaries. This honest approach helps build more inclusive and meaningful connections, letting people enjoy their relationships without stressing about expensive dates. It's about building bonds that prioritise understanding and care over monetary considerations. 115905280",

    "description1": "The news of Indian badminton star and double Olympic medallist, PV Sindhu's wedding to IT professional Venkata Datta Sai came as a wonderful surprise for her fans and followers today. Sindhu's father PV Ramana told PTI that her wedding was confirmed just a month ago, and December 22nd is picked as her wedding date in Udaipur followed by a grand reception in Hyderabad on December 24th. While much is known about PV Sindhu as a sports star, did you know that she also has an elder sister who was also a sportsperson? Well, read on to know more about her here.Meet PV Sindhu's elder sisterPV Sindhu's sister PV Divya is seven years older than her, and she was also a national-level sports person. However, unlike PV Sindhu, PV Divya was a handball player but later on, she quit sports and instead pursued academics to become a doctor.In 2012, PV Divya married Sreeram Goalla in a grand wedding. However, PV Sindhu missed her sister's wedding for her sport! Incidentally, PV Sindhu's sister's wedding happened to be on the same day as her final match at the Syed Modi International India Grand Prix back then due to which she had to miss her sister's big day. At the time, when PV Sindhu was asked about missing her sister's wedding day for her final match, she had told IANS, \"I will try to win the tournament and give it as a gift to her.\" Unfortunately, Sindhu lost the match to Indonesia’s Lindaweni Fanetri.Meanwhile, the sister",
    "description2": "s seem to share a close bond as PV Sindhu often posts pictures with her lesser-known elder sister and even her brother-in-law on her social media profile.Recalling a fond childhood memory with her sister PV Divya, PV Sindhu once told Forbes India in an interview, \"She (Divya) was more into studies. She wanted to become a doctor back then and she was showing a lot of interest in her studies. She used to play well; at the school level, she used to be number one. Even studies... She studies well. She used to play basketball and netball. There was this small incident when I was pretty young. My sister and my cousin were playing badminton near my house and I wanted to play with them. And we are seven years apart; she (Divya) is older than me... So when they were playing badminton, I was like 'Let me also join you and play', and they were like 'You don't know how to play'. So when I look back, I'm like 'Okay, let's see' and we all laugh at it! But it was a really funny incident and nobody thought that I would be a champion and be here today.\"PV Sindhu's parents115942026PV Sindhu's parents-- father PV Ramana and mother P Vijaya-- have been national-level volleyball players of their time. This shows their family's love, interest, and inclination towards sports from an early age. In fact, Sindhu's father PV Ramana was a part of the 1986 Seoul Asian Games that had won a bronze medal.115922310115904040115706960115737296",

    "description1": "Forgiveness is an invaluable gift-- both for the one who is forgiven and more so, for the one who forgives. The one who is forgiven, one who is contrite, repentant, can move on, grateful for being forgiven. Otherwise, feelings of regret, shame and guilt can make us miserable and haunt us for the rest of our lives. The one who forgives and then forgets, moves on, feeling lighter and happier. This is an important step in achieving inner peace and joy. When we forgive, we no longer live in the past. We no longer latch onto our hurt. We no longer curse, nurse and rehearse it. We reverse it. We put an end to it. Carrying a grudge or hatred in our hearts is like carrying a load on our heads. It is like carrying thorns in our hearts, thorns that constantly poke us, prick us and hurt us. It’s a heavy burden to carry. Just like anger is like a piece of burning coal that burns us before it burns those it is directed at, grudges too can first impact us negatively, and overwhelm us, leading to feelings of anxiety, resentment, vengefulness, and hatred. Imagine letting go of the root cause of such misery! Imagine eliminating toxic feelings — the toxicity of anger, vengefulness, and bitterness. Imagine the freedom it would give; the happiness and peace it would create! When we let go of grudges and hatred, when we forgive, it paves the way for happiness, peace, compassion and love. Stress and anguish are reduced. When we forgive, we can let go of the past and focus on today, on what we have. And one of the secrets to being peaceful and happy is to live in the present - not with the regrets of yesterday but with the joys of the present, in the moment. As stated in the scripture, when Peter had asked Jesus, ‘Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?’ Jesus had said, ‘I tell you, not",
    "description2": " seven times, but seventy-seven times.’ This actually means endlessly. Just like we expect God, the Supreme Immortal Power, to forgive us, no matter how many times we err, we must also learn to forgive others. But why do we need to forgive? And why do we develop such feelings of resentment and anger? Because we feel that either we have been wronged or someone we love has been wronged. Hence, we carry grudges towards people and there is a need to forgive because of those grudges. The grudge is between ‘me’ and ‘you’. Speaking from a spiritual perspective, these differences are caused by duality. Because of the feeling, ‘I am I’ and ‘you are you.’ But what if is there no duality? Does the right hand hold a grudge against the left hand? Does the right leg have to forgive the left leg? Does the left eye scream at the right eye? No, they don’t. Because they are not considered separate entities. They are a part of one body. This is non-duality. In reality, we develop differences, and we start hating each other because we don’t realize that we are one. Therefore, hatred and forgiveness exist because of our ignorance. We think that we are different beings. As a result, we have expectations. Our relationships become transactional, there are hurts and there is the need to forgive. The truth is that we are not different. We are one. We are all a part of that one Divine Supreme Power. When we realize this, then the power of forgiveness becomes the power of God. Then, healing is more than forgiveness. There is a sense of oneness. We treat everybody with love and reverence, as a manifestation of the Divine. We hold no anger or resentment. Then neither do we harbour grudges, nor do we have any need to forgive.Authored by: AiR- Atman in Ravi, author, singer, philanthropist and happiness ambassador 115904040 115706960 115919501 112572519",

    "description1": "Having a successful career, a full-time job and a love life can be very stressful and demanding. As you age finding the right partner for yourself becomes more difficult. You are either in your office hustling or slogging to get the perfect grades, all to fit into this competitive world. When you already have so much on your plate, finding the right person can be very exhausting. You would rather spend some quiet time with yourself.However, parents often may not understand the complexities of the modern world and this may put undue pressure on people who wish to remain single. In Vietnam, a large number of young people are hiring fake partners to navigate societal and familial pressure; this allows you to have a full-time career, and the challenge of finding the right match sheds light on the intense cultural expectations surrounding marriage and family life. 115939341 115862966According to the South China Morning Post, Minh Thu, a 30-year-old from Nam Dinh, was overwhelmed by her demanding career and constant pressure from her parents to settle down and give them a grandchild, so she decided to hire a fake boyfriend earlier this year. After spending a hundred dollars, she found a 35-year-old construction engineer who became her fake boyfriend. Her parents convinced her to bring her boyfriend home for the lunar new year.Min Thu said, “On the day he came to my house, he helped my mom cook and chatted with my relatives. It’s been a long time since I’ve se",
    "description2": "en my parents so happy and proud of me,” Thu told Vietnamese media outlet VnExpress. The arrangement, meticulously planned in advance, included sharing family backgrounds and creating an emotional connection to make their act convincing.The publication also talked about the story of Khanh Ngoc, a 33-year-old girl who had never been in a relationship, rented a boyfriend, which improved her relationship with her parents; she was relieved she didn't have to dodge the uncomfortable conversation about her single status. 115939374One of the popular providers, Huy Tuan, a 25-year-old from Hanoi, has been in this business for over a year, catering to clients seeking opportunities for coffee dates, shopping outings, or family gatherings. His rates vary according to the need and occasion; casual outings are around US$10-20 for two hours, and family meetings are up to US$40. Tuan explained to the South China Morning Post that he has to go to the gym, learn to sing and cook, take pictures, and work on his conversational skills to meet the expectations of many clients. There are strict contrasts involved that prohibit emotional attachment and sexual relationships with clients.Fake dating may sound fun or casual, but it also has a few risks, like getting emotionally attached to the person you hired, sexual harassment encounters, breaking the hearts of friends and families, and losing their valuable trust; all are the major consequences of hiring a fake date. 115905280",

    "description1": "Optical illusion personality tests have become quite popular among people these days. The reason: These are strange-looking images which can be interpreted in different ways by different people. Depending on what one sees in these images, a lot can be decoded about the person as these images are based on psychology.This particular image, which was designed by optical illusion specialist Mia Yilin on TikTok, claims to reveal if a person is thoughtful and good at problem-solving or indecisive in nature. At first glance, a person can see either a man's face or a human hand first in the image. And depending on what a person notices first, their hidden personality traits can be decoded.To take this test, simply look at the image and read its interpretation below:1. If you noticed a shouting man's face firstThen it means that you are a deeply thoughtful, caring and considerate person. You often reflect upon your actions; this comes naturally to you and it helps you grow as a person. However, this shouldn't make you too hard on yourself. Remember to be kind to yourself too",
    "description2": ", and accept yourself as you are. On the contrary, being a deep thinker also helps you be a better problem solver than others as you can observe the problem and find different solutions to it.2. If you noticed a human hand firstHowever, if you fall in the second category of people who saw the human hand first then it means that you are good at quick thinking. You work better under stress and easily navigate life's challenges. But when given choices, making a decision seems a bit difficult for you and you come across as someone who is indecisive.A word of cautionWhile optical illusion personality tests are a fun way to know your hidden traits, one must take these tests with a pinch of salt as they are not always 100 percent accurate. These tests give generic results, so they might not fit or suit everyone accurately all the time. However, it does help one know themselves in a better way.So, tell us how accurate this test was for you in the comments section below.Also, do share it with your friends and family to know them better. 115720398 115808404 115706960 99951332",

    "description1": "Surya Namaskara is a full-body workout that combines 12 asanas (postures), each engaging different muscle groups. Performing five rounds of Surya Namaskara (Sun Salutation) daily can have profound physical, mental, and spiritual benefits. \"In contrast to all other Asanas which work on a particular part of the body, Suryanamaskar is a complete Health capsule for the whole body,\" a study done in 2022 and published in \"Suryanamaskar helps in mobilizing the joints and in increasing one's physical stamina by enabling them to breathe to their fullest capacity. Most importantly, it helps them to preserve the health of the spine by allowing them to sustain comfortably in sitting postures for a longer time during the practice of pranayama and meditation,\" the researchers have explained. 115954574Stressing on yogic breathing, the review study found that the breathing component of Surya Namaskara plays a vital role in enhancing lung capacity and optimizing respiratory function. Through regular practice, it naturally encourages longer and deeper inhalations and exhalations, aligning with the breathing patterns emphasized in Pranayama techniques. This conscious breathing not only supports oxygenation but also facilitates the efficient elimination of toxins from the body, as exhalation is a primary mechanism",
    "description2": " for detoxification. Over time, the practice refines and strengthens the breath, promoting overall respiratory health and vitality.The dynamic flow between poses raises your heart rate like light cardio. It promotes circulation and enhances oxygenation of all parts of the body; thus, a healthy heart. With continuous practice, the major muscle groups such as the arms, legs, and abdomen will be toning. Every round of Surya Namaskar burns calories, a healthy way of weight maintenance.Breathing in deep, slow rhythms with each posture will activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which decreases cortisol (stress hormones), while the focus necessary to coordinate breath with movement enhances cognitive functions such as concentration and memory.How to do Surya Namaskar effectively?Start by light stretching and loosening the muscles. Practice this activity on an empty stomach; ideally in the morning in comfortable clothes.Maintain correct posture with each position to avoid accidents. Now flow between all 12 poses keeping balance, and stability throughout.You breathe in through upward actions and out on downward motions. Use slow, deep rhythmic breaths. It improves flow.Start with 3-5 rounds and increase gradually. Focus on mindfulness, connect breath, body, and mind to maximize benefits. 115443349",

    "description1": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising our healthcare systems. Dr Prateek Sharma, president of American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and chair for its AI task force who will be delivering the keynote address at the 65th annual conference of Indian Society of Gastroenterology in Varanasi in Dec, talks about the pros and cons of AI-powered healthcare.What is all the buzz about AI in Health?AI is making an impact in healthcare, changing the way diseases are diagnosed, managed and even prevented. Once seen only as science fiction and in movies, AI has quickly moved from research labs into hospitals, clinics and even our phones. What does this mean for everyday patients, and how does it work?At the basic level, AI is about teaching computers to recognize patterns, learn from data, and make predictions. In healthcare, it means that AI tools can go through large amounts of information, such as patient images or patient histories, and help doctors make faster, more accurate decisions. For example, AI can now aid doctors by analyzing X-rays and MRIs, to detect diseases like cancer. By examining such images and recognizing subtle changes that can often be missed by the human eye, AI can help spot signs of skin, lung or breast cancers sooner. Similar to X-rays, AI can assist pathologists in diagnosing diseases from biopsy images, increasing accuracy and efficiency.Is AI in healthcare available only in hospitals?AI can also improve patient care outside the hospital. Virtual assistants and chatbots on smartphone apps can now guide people through managing chronic conditions like diabetes or heart disease. These apps use AI to keep a check on patient health and provide personalized advice — reminders to take medications, exercise recommendations, and even alerts to see a doctor if necessary. Take for example diabetes, a very common condition in India. There are platforms and apps available for diabetes management, using AI to provide personalized tips and suggestions to patients at home based on their real-time blood sugar data.These tools offer patients more control over their health, which is especially important in rural areas and parts of the country with limited access to doctors. Digital health tools such as telemedicine can connect patients in remote areas with doctors in metro cities, reducing the need for long travel distances or if specialty care is not locally available. How else does AI help doctors and patients?One of the most important ways that AI can impact healthcare is to help with the automation of common time-consuming work such as scheduling appointments, billing, maintaining medical records, writing patient notes, sending referrals etc. This will free up time for the doctors, reduce the administrative burden so that doctors can focus on the patients and spend more time",
    "description2": " in their treatment. Currently available large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT/Gemini can assist by generating clinical notes during patient interactions and provide them with educational material.What are some of the risks of using AI in healthcare?AI in healthcare also brings some challenges, such as patient privacy, data security and potential mistakes made by AI. AI depends on large amounts of patient data and keeping this data secure and private is a big challenge. An AI system can make a mistake which could lead to a wrong diagnosis or treatment. To avoid this, human oversight is extremely important. Also, AI systems should undergo high levels of testing before their use. To develop and maintain AI technology is costly, and so many small clinics or low-income areas cannot afford it. Since ChatGPT/Gemini type tools are accessible, it could lead to over-reliance on AI, impacting the doctor’s clinical judgment and the human touch in treating patients. Such LLMs can sometimes provide outdated information and it is important to remember that they lack medical expertise and are not trained on specific medical literature. LLMs may provide answers that sound very accurate and reasonable but are clinically incorrect. It is our job as doctors to double check and confirm AI generated information.Does this mean that patients will be treated by AI and not by doctors?Absolutely not. While AI will definitely help the care of patients, it will never replace the human expertise and compassion provided by doctors. The future of AI in medicine is about partnership, where doctors and AI work together to deliver the best treatment. We have to use easily available tools like ChatGPT/Gemini very carefully to complement the expertise of the doctor. The medical community must balance innovation with caution, so that technology improves — rather than replaces — the human connection in medicine.Sharing of medical documents like X-rays and MRI scans with an AI chatbot, such as Elon Musk’s Grok on X, has recently been encouraged. What are the benefits and risks?This may provide the public with a simplified understanding of medical images/documents, helping them better understand their health condition/diseases. However, users need to be aware of data privacy, transparency, bias and ethical issues associated with such public sharing of data. Not fully understanding how their data is being used, stored or shared could lead to unethical exploitation of users’ medical information. Besides, the lack of regulatory approval for AI chatbots like Grok means they may not be adequately trained, or may be using biased data which could lead to less reliable clinical interpretation, misdiagnoses or incomplete feedback. Medical management requires expertise and context, which an AI tool will lack without a doctor’s oversight.",

    "description1": "Walking is man’s best medicine.” These words of Hippocrates couldn’t ring truer in a world where we are clocking more and more steps to realise health goals. But what about the frail and elderly, for whom walking is an uphill task? German scientists have tailored just the device for them — robotic shorts.Researchers from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have come up with a backpack-like motorised system that can help people walk for miles with much less energy expended. “You can walk slowly with the shorts, but you can also jog. We have developed a system that makes people want to move around more. It’s the same concept as the electric bike, but for walking,” TUM professor Lorenzio Masia states in a press release. The research was published in Nature Machine Intelligence journal.Masia says the wearable, suitably named WalkON, is particularly useful for elderly people and those weakened by illness (heart or lung disease) but do not need wheeled walkers. “Walking helps improve their metabolism which, in turn, may have a positive effect on their illness,” he said.Doctoral student Enrica Tricomi demonstrated how the portable and lightweight robotic shorts work in a",
    "description2": " video by putting on the ‘backpack’ and strapping it with a waist belt. She then strapped two thigh harnesses connected to the waist belt with two thin, artificial tendons, and motion sensors on the outer sides. The tendons gauge the hip angle and velocity through an attached measuring device, helping the user walk easily by relieving the hip flexors (muscles in the upper thigh that help move the leg upwards). “The system recognises how fast or slowly the person is moving, adapts to the respective weight of the legs, and provides individual support,” Tricomi says. The research found that when someone young walks 500m uphill wearing the shorts, their expended energy (known as metabolic cost) is reduced by 18% compared to regular walking. And for an elderly person walking 400m on a flat surface wearing the device, the metabolic cost is cut by more than 10%. It’s like the effect of losing 6-10kg of body weight. Walking is known to boost immune function, and protects the joints. Another plus is that the device doesn’t take over the user’s agency. So, the elderly can be out and about for longer without feeling that they are dependent on an external aid for walking. Agencies",

    "description1": "Dr Viswanathan IyerOne fine day in my clinic, I saw Mr MK, a chirpy 52-year-old man accompanied by his wife and young son. He was referred to me by Dr Anuradha Ayyar, an ophthalmologist who specialises in the intricate plastic and reconstructive surgery of the eye and orbit. The orbit is the cavity or socket in the skull that houses the eye and its appendages. Typically, a patient who has been meticulously evaluated by a colleague and referred for further care tends to be both a gift and a test at once. Since the patient has already undergone a battery of tests and reached a provisional diagnosis, the further referral is either for reconfirmation of the diagnosis, certain advanced investigations or for definitive treatment. So, when such a patient walks into the clinic, their anticipation from you is bound to be high, as the cross-referral is a testament to the trust placed by the referring colleague.“Very interesting” is how Dr Anuradha had described Mr MK, who had markedly elevated blood sugar levels and hypertension when he first walked into her hospital on a bright Monday morning. He had recently been discharged from a hospital after receiving a course of steroid and antibiotic injections for protrusion of his left eye. The oral steroids post discharge had catapulted his blood sugar levels. He had sought the expertise of several eye surgeons for his swollen left eye, and other specialists to manage his blood sugar and thyroid issues. However, despite treatment, his condition had deteriorated, and he now experienced blurred vision. The scans, when Dr Anuradha examined them, revealed a dilated vein in his eye. Suspecting an abnormal connection of the blood vessels in his brain, she advised him to undergo an MRI scan, which confirmed her hunch. She decided to refer the patient to a brain specialist for treatment.115939960In the presence of h",
    "description2": "is wife and son, when I examined Mr MK’s scan, it revealed a protrusion of the left eye, along with engorged veins akin to what we observe when we use a tourniquet on the forearm prior to blood sampling. Mr MK appeared deeply perturbed by his condition, if not thoroughly exasperated by the lack of a definitive diagnosis.I recommended a cerebral angiogram to find the cause of the engorged veins. This is similar to the procedure performed by cardiologists to visualise the blood supply of the heart. The angiogram threw up an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins of the eye’s orbit, resulting in elevated pressure. This pressure impeded the outflow of deoxygenated blood from the eye. The treatment was to disrupt and delay the blood flow into the eye, promoting the closure of the abnormal connection. While this may sound complex in theory, the solution — as I saw it — was rather simple and practical. Instead of writing down a prescription, I pressed down two fingers on my neck to show the 52-year-old what he must do at home: repeatedly compress an artery in his neck using his fingers. He diligently performed this manoeuvre to the T for two weeks. A fortnight later, when he returned to my clinic, I didn’t need to see his bloodwork to tell that he was completely cured. The smile of relief on his face reached both the right and the left eye, which was no longer swollen. For me, the case gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ‘hands-on treatment’. While the road to his diagnosis may have been technically complicated, all it took to restore Mr MK’s vision and spirits was a quick, simple self-treatment. Like many things in the age of information, medical answers too at times rest — quite literally — on our fingertips.

    "description": "Beyond local foods, this travel trend helps people form a deeper connection to a destination’s daily life and traditions.",
    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/11/grocery_1600_getty_378306.jpg",
    "description1": "Travellers often flock to museums, forts, parks, and restaurants to explore a country’s essence. But many enthusiasts are now discovering a destination’s soul through its grocery stores and supermarkets. This unique travel trend, aptly \"Grocery Store Tourism,\" allows visitors to engage with a region’s food culture by experiencing local flavours, ingredients, and consumer habits. Simply put, it's a way of experiencing a culture through its food systems and native consumer habits rather than traditional tourist attractions. “Grocery store tourism shows what makes a destination unique. Unlike restaurants or traditional food markets, supermarkets offer insights into the daily life of the residents. From deciphering Japanese miso paste labels and seaweed snacks to browsing French artisanal cheese aisles, these spaces reflect a region’s culinary identity,” said Jatinder Paul Singh, CEO and co-founder of Viacation. In a New York magazine write-up, writer Richard Morgan once called grocery stores “the secret museum in every city”, and said he learned more while in a grocery store in Bogotá, Colombia, than he did at the city's Museum of Gold. This tourism trend offers affordable, fun, authentic experiences. “From small-town farmer markets to gourmet boutiques, grocery stores have tourists showing up to discover local ingredients in small towns and sampling condiments unique to the destination, at the tap of a card and a reasonable price point for experimentation,\" said Sridhar Keppurengan, head of Cross Border Payments, India and South Asia, Visa. A peak into local life For some, grocery store tourism means more than just sampling local snacks. It’s about feeling like a local. Janani Gopalakrishnan, 30, a fintech product manager, recalled relishing a \"delicious local dessert\" Mitarashi Dango in a supermarket outside Mt Fuji in Japan while observing locals pick bento-box lunches. \"It was nice to see a slice of everyday Japanese culture. It felt like the true meaning of finding joy in the ordinary,\" said Gopalakrishnan, who also said she has loved grocery tourism since childhood. \"It provides local ingredients and products as souvenirs that extend the journey after the trip. If visited with curiosity, one may discover some hidden culinary gems while gaining a greater appreciation for everyday life in one's destination,\" said Singh. In countries like Italy or France, you might find regional olive oils, vinegar, or chocolates. In Southeast Asia, people often search for specialty spices or noodles. \"The focus is on learning how food is grown, processed, and consumed, and sometimes even discovering new recipes based on the items found,\" mentioned Chef Nitten Chughh, culinary director, Caravela Beach Resort, South Goa. A global phenomenon Agoda's upcoming 2025 travel trend survey showed that experiencing local cultures continues to be one of the top reasons for travel. \"Large supermarkets serve as cultural mirrors, showing local preferences in how they present products and fresh foods. These ",
    "description2": "aisles tell stories of a region's agricultural bounty and culinary heritage,\" said Krishna Rathi, senior country director, India Subcontinent and MEA at Agoda. \"For instance, the famous ham and cheese toasties from 7/11 in Thailand, a simple yet delightful treat that has become a must-try for visitors. In Japan, the variety of exclusive convenience store snacks, from matcha-flavoured KitKats to unique onigiri, provides a taste of the country's innovative approach to food,\" she said. Indian tourists have embraced this trend, seeking deeper connections with foreign cultures. Keppurengan noted that Visa data showed Indian travellers spending more on groceries in countries like Sweden, Spain, and Australia. \"Over the past three years, Indians have been spending proportionately more on food and grocery in European countries such as Sweden, Switzerland, and Spain – regions known for their exotic spices, fresh organic produce, and quintessential delicacies. Lately, we’ve seen a similar trend among Indian tourists to spend on groceries when travelling across Australia, Indonesia, and Malaysia as well,\" said Keppurengan. In a country like India, grocery tourism provides opportunities for hands-on learning about food cultivation, preparation, and cooking techniques. \"Some regions of India host food festivals and culinary tours that include visits to local grocery stores and markets, where participants can learn about traditional food preparation, regional ingredients, and even participate in cooking demonstrations,\" said Chughh. A sustainable, \"Instagrammable\" experience Grocery tourism also caters to eco-conscious travelers. Many destinations promote organic, locally grown products or sustainable practices, drawing those who value ethical consumption. Social media has amplified the trend, with influencers sharing unique grocery hauls, talking about exotic snacks and local specialties. Travellers today are keen to learn about the origins of their meals and to take a piece of the destination home with them, whether it's crispy seaweed or pizza dry yeast recommended by the chef at a restaurant. “Food content has become a dominant travel theme. Grocery stores are now Instagrammable destinations—authentic, experiential, and surprisingly affordable,\" said Keppurengan. Popular destinations for grocery tourism, as per Chughh Tokyo, Japan: Known for its well-organised supermarkets, bustling fish markets like Tsukiji (or Toyosu now), and specialty food items. Barcelona, Spain: Markets like La Boqueria offer a colourful experience of Spanish food culture, from fresh seafood to cured meats and artisan cheeses. Paris, France: Visiting small neighbourhood shops and larger stores like La Grande Epicerie offers a great experience of French food products, from pastries to gourmet chocolates. Mexico City, Mexico: The city's bustling mercados are filled with exotic fruits, spices, and indigenous foods. A visit to these markets offers insights into Mexican cuisine that go beyond the typical tourist spots.",

    "description1": "Chhavi Hussein recently shared her experience with botox, highlighting the risks that come with the procedure. In a conversation with venereologist Dr Agni Kumar Bose on her podcast, she revealed, “This was the first time I ever got a needle done to the face… I’m not scared of pain, I’m not scared of needles. My pain threshold, I believe, is very high. But it was something I was not anticipating.” She revealed that a slight movement during the procedure caused the botox to be injected in the wrong spot. “Main thodi hili, aur unka haath thoda hila (So I moved a little, and their hand moved a little)… and the Botox went in the wrong place. And I had a paralysed face for over a year. As an actor, it was a very, very tough phase for me,” she said. &nbsp; View this post on Instagram &nbsp; A post shared by Chhavi Mittal (@chhavihussein) Botox, often seen as a quick fix for wrinkles and fine lines, is generally considered safe when performed by trained professionals. However, as Mittal’s experience shows, even small mistakes can have lasting consequences.  Dr Gunasekar Vuppalapati, senior aesthetic, reconstructive, plastic surgeon at GVG Invivo Hospital, tells indianexpress.com, “Botox (botulinum toxin type A) is a neurotoxin that temporarily blocks nerve signals to the muscles where it is injected. By inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, it prevents muscle contractions, reducing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. Botox is also used therapeutically for conditions like migraines, hyperhidrosis, and muscle spasms.” Why movement during injection can cause issues, according to the plastic surgeon Misplacement of Botox: Movement during the procedure can cause the needle to target the wrong muscle or allow the Botox to spread to unintended areas. For instance, if Botox, meant for the forehead muscles, migrates to the eyelid muscles, it can cause ptosis (droopy eyelid). Inaccurate Dosing: Slight move",
    "description2": "ments can lead to uneven distribution of the toxin, resulting in asymmetry or incomplete results. Increased Risk of Migration: Movement immediately after the procedure can displace the toxin, potentially affecting nearby muscles and causing complications like facial paralysis. But, what are the risks? Dr Vuppalapati lists the common side effects and risks of getting Botox: Bruising and Swelling: Minor bruising or swelling at the injection site is the most common side effect and usually resolves within a few days. Asymmetry: If Botox is not injected evenly or in the correct muscles, it can result in uneven facial expressions, such as a droopy eyelid or a lopsided smile. Facial Paralysis: In rare cases, Botox can spread to unintended muscles, causing temporary paralysis, as seen in Chhavi’s case. Headaches or Flu-like Symptoms: Some individuals experience mild headaches or flu-like symptoms after the procedure. Allergic Reactions: Though rare, Botox can cause itching, rashes, or other allergic reactions. Difficulty Swallowing or Speaking: When Botox migrates near the throat or vocal cords, it can temporarily interfere with these functions. How to avoid these risks Dr Vuppalapati shares the following tips: Choose a Qualified Practitioner: Ensure the injector is a certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon with extensive experience in facial anatomy. Communicate Clearly: Discuss your medical history, allergies, and expectations with your practitioner. Stay Still During the Procedure: Movement during injection can lead to misplacement of the Botox. Follow Aftercare Instructions: To prevent Botox migration, avoid rubbing the treated area, lying down for several hours, or engaging in strenuous activities immediately after the procedure.

    "description1": "Under our What Happens to Your Body series, we have covered many stories highlighting the pros and cons of various everyday things and how they affect well-being. Continuing with the same, today—ahead of the New Year 2025—we find out what happens to the body if you commit to no sweets, 10,000 steps daily, and home-cooked meals for the next 30 days. Committing to no sweets, 10k steps, and eating home-cooked meals for 30 days can lead to significant physical changes, experts suggest. \"This can be a part of healthy habits that can be rewarding and lead to a range of health benefits,\" said Dr Manjusha Agarwal, senior consultant, internal medicine, Gleneagles Hospital Parel Mumbai. What are the changes you can notice? If you want to lose weight, cutting out your sugar intake can be beneficial. However, in the first few days, you might start craving sugar, which can make you fussy, cranky, and moody. This can be referred to as sugar withdrawal, as your body needs some time to adjust and lower blood sugar levels. \"One may notice that their ene",
    "description2": "rgy levels may become stable and consistent as one progresses in this journey,\" said Dr Agarwal. Cutting out sugar, and being regular with physical activities like walking and eating home-cooked food can lead to weight loss and also improve digestion. \"However, one should ensure that their meals contain plenty of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains enriched with the goodness of essential nutrients like vitamins, fibre, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and carbohydrates,\" said Dr Agarwal. Lack of essential nutrients in daily meals can lead to nutrient deficiency, which can negatively affect overall health. \"One should consider consulting a doctor before beginning with this new regime, especially those with health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or blood sugar levels. Your doctor may assess your condition and suggest accordingly,\" said Dr Agarwal. DISCLAIMER: This article is based on information from the public domain and/or the experts we spoke to.

    "description1": "Chyawanprash isn’t just an ancient tonic - it's an all-in-one immune and energy booster for the cold months. With its powerful blend of meticulously chosen herbs, it nourishes not just our body but also our mind and spirit. Health and wellness coach Isha Lall shared that the name \"Chyawanprash\" or “Chyavanprash” traces back to Sage Chyavan, a revered ancient sage who is believed to have regained his eyesight, youth, and vitality with this very tonic. \"According to Ayurvedic texts, particularly the Bhavaprakasha and Charaka Samhita, Chyavan had become old and frail but was rejuvenated after taking a mixture of medicinal herbs guided by Ashvins. This formula, later known as Chyawanprash or Chyavanprash, is believed to restore strength, enhance longevity, and increase immunity,\" she said. Fashion designer Masaba Gupta took to her Instagram story to thank her friend for sharing homemade chyawanprash. But how can you make this winter staple at home? Indianexpress.com got an easy recipe from celebrity chef Ananya Banerjee. Ingredients: Amla (Indian Gooseberry) – 500g (fresh or dried) Jaggery or honey – 300g (natural sweetener) Ghee – 100g Sesame oil – 1 tablespoon Spices: Cardamom powder – 1 teaspoon Cinnamon powder – 1 teaspoon Clove powder – ½ teaspoon Nutmeg powder – ½ teaspoon Herbs (optional but beneficial): Ashwagandha powder – 1 teaspoon Shatavari powder – 1 teaspoon Guduchi powder – 1 teaspoon Dried fruits (optional): Raisins, dates, or figs – 50g (chopped) Honey – Optional for extra sweetness (add only when the mixture cools to prevent losing nutrie",
    "description2": "nts) Method: If using fresh amla, steam or boil them until soft. Remove seeds and mash into a pulp. If using dried amla, soak them overnight and blend into a paste. Heat a heavy-bottomed pan with ghee and sesame oil. Add the amla pulp and sauté for 10–15 minutes until the mixture reduces and thickens. Gradually add jaggery or honey and cook on low heat until it melts and blends well with the amla mixture. Add the powdered spices and herbs, mixing thoroughly. If using dried fruits, stir them in at this stage. Continue to cook on low heat until the mixture thickens further and begins to leave the sides of the pan. Stir constantly to avoid burning. Let the Chyawanprash cool completely before transferring it into an airtight jar. Store in a cool, dry place. It stays fresh for months if refrigerated. What are its health benefits? Lall said that chyawanprash’s formulation is derived from classical Ayurvedic texts such as the Charaka Samhita, Bhavaprakasha, and Rasa Ratna Samuchaya. \"The ingredients, such as amla (for immunity) and ashwagandha (for stress management), and ghee and spices (to enhance digestive fire/agni and promote better nutrient absorption) are precisely chosen for their rejuvenating and balancing properties,\" she explained. What is the ideal amount to have in a day? Lall said that chyawanprash is best taken daily in moderate amounts. For adults, 1 tablespoon (15-20g) in the morning and for children, 1 teaspoon (5-10g) once or twice a day should suffice. If you have excess kapha, she suggested reducing the dosage or diluting with warm water.",

    "description1": "Maintaining a good hygiene is important for your health. It is especially important to make a habit of washing your hands frequently,  but overindulgence in this habit could prove to be very unhealthy for your skin! Dr S M Fayaz, Consultant - Internal Medicine at Aster Whitefield Hospital, Bangalore tells indianexpress.com how it is necessary to maintain your hygiene habits as well as take care of your skin. Excessive handwashing is often linked to psychological disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), where the urge to wash hands over and over again comes from repetitive rituals that are meant to ease worries about germs or contamination. Moreover, people with general health anxiety might also wash their hands excessively to get rid of fears of illness, finding temporary relief in the act. How can excessive handwashing affect your skin? \"Frequent handwashing or even excessive usage of hand sanitizers can lead to skin irritation and other problems. It can strip the skin of its natural oils, causing dryness, redness, and irritation.\" said Dr Fayaz. It can remove the skin's natural oils, leading to dryness, redness, and irritation. Rashes from hand washing",
    "description2": " usually appear on the backs of the hands and between the fingers, making the skin more prone to conditions like eczema or dermatitis, which cause inflammation, itching, and cracking. How often is it recommended to wash your hands daily? \"For most people, washing hands 5 to 10 times a day is sufficient in order to maintain hygiene and be protected from germs and bacteria.\" said Dr Fayaz. The necessary times for hand washing are before and after meals, after using the restroom, and following coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose. It’s also important to wash them after touching shared surfaces or objects, such as public transportation or doorknobs, and whenever your hands are visibly dirty. However, if handwashing is causing skin problems, it may be beneficial to review handwashing practices and keep your hands moisturized. For this, you can apply a rich hand cream or lotion containing ingredients like glycerin, shea butter, or ceramides. You can also go for hand lotions with hydrating ingredients such as hyaluronic acid. Additionally, wash your hands with lukewarm water rather than hot water, and gently pat them dry with a soft towel instead of rubbing them together.",

    "description1": "Ananya Panday has been in the spotlight this year owing to back-to-back performances. From Call Me Bae to CTRL, her acting has been garnering praises from critics and masses alike. In a recent conversation with Mojo Story, she shared her experience with body image issues and how social media played an active role in it. \"Instagram does that to you. Nobody posts their failures on Instagram. You are constantly comparing yourself with someone who you think has a better life or is constantly travelling or looking happy. I also obviously had that.\" She also added that self love is something that doesn’t happen overnight. \"I have days when I don’t feel confident and beautiful. But, you have to just go through that phase. You need to go with it and not be hard on yourself. As an actor, the most I can do is talk and let people know that I too have such days,\" revealed the Kho Gaye Hum Kahan actor. Indianexpress.com spoke to counselling psychologist Srishti Vatsa and understood how social media fuels comparison and what can you do to navigate such situations. \"Comparison, in general, can lead to feelings of unhappiness and dissatisfaction. It’s important to understand the difference between healthy competition and unhealthy comparison. The constant showcasing of lives on social media is often driven by a need for validation. Social media makes it easy to see what others are doing, which can lead to constant comparisons - especially in relationships,\" explained Vatsa. According to her, what people show online is often far from reality, but many end up feeling inadeq",
    "description2": "uate in their own lives or relationships while chasing the \"perfect\" images they see. This can lead to frustration, sadness, or resentment. Piyali Maity, Clinical Director, Counselling Operations, 1to1help, added that social media fuels comparison in several ways especially with “selective sharing”. \"The reel v/s reality is the most common, where people share only the best portions of their lives which are far from day-to-day reality. The widespread use of filters and editing tools further increases the gap between reality and what is portrayed, making others’ lives appear more glamorous or perfect.\" She added that the validation that one gets from increased followers, likes and comments on the posts unconsciously leads to comparing one's popularity or success with others. \"What makes it worse is the constant exposure to updates and fulfilling experiences of others which can trigger one to compare oneself and feel like they are missing out on something better in life,\" she said. Social media can inspire some people, but it’s important to recognize when it starts having a negative impact. If you find yourself constantly comparing, overspending to match trends, or feeling unhappy with your own life, it’s time to take a step back and reflect. To avoid these pitfalls, Vatsa suggested setting limits on your social media usage and focus on spending time with people in real life. Mindless scrolling, especially when it’s used to escape from reality, can be harmful. It creates a cycle of seeking quick dopamine hits, which can hurt productivity and mental well-being.",

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/sleep.jpg",
    "description1": "Is excessive zoning out a bad sign? Mehezabin Dordi, clinical psychologist at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital, notes that while zoning out occasionally is not serious, it can evolve into a problem when it starts to significantly impact daily life, productivity, and relationships. \"If you do find yourself frequently disengaged during important tasks or conversations, it might indicate some underlying issues such as attention deficit disorders, anxiety, or depression.\" But zoning out isn’t all bad. In fact, it can serve as a mental break from the constant focus your brain endures. Your brain needs time to recharge, and when napping isn’t an option, zoning out can be helpful, Dordi explains. It could also boost creativity and improve problem-solving skills. Taking moments to zone out can aid in \"processing your emotions\" or allow for brief, reflective thinking. When does it become serious? \"If someone finds themselves frequently disengaged during important tasks or conversations, it might indicate underlying issues such as attention deficit disorders, anxiety, or depression,\" says Mehezabin. While social media has popularised the term ‘dissociation,’ it is important to note that it is distinct from zoning ",
    "description2": "out. Dissociation refers to a more severe form of mental disconnection, often linked to trauma or extreme stress. This deeper detachment can make individuals feel disconnected from their thoughts, feelings, or surroundings, to an extent that it impairs their functioning. How to recognise if it’s a problem If you find yourself zoning out more often than you'd like but aren't sure whether it’s serious, consider incorporating these practices: Practice Mindfulness Engage in meditation or deep breathing exercises to heighten awareness and control over your thoughts, which can help reduce the tendency to zone out. Structure Your Breaks Taking regular, intentional breaks during work or study sessions can help combat mental fatigue and reduce the urge for the mind to wander. Prioritise Tasks Creating a clear to-do list with organised tasks and goals can help maintain focus and minimize the chances of zoning out. Seek Professional Help If zoning out is having a significant impact on your daily life, consulting with a mental health professional can be beneficial. Striking the right balance between productive mind-wandering and problematic zoning out is essential for maintaining cognitive health and overall well-being.",

    "description1": "By Mannat Saini Vir Das, a celebrated Indian comedian, actor, and singer, made history as the first Indian to host the International Emmy Awards 2024, in New York. As soon as Das was named the Emmy host, he had extended an invitation on social media inviting young designers across India to create the perfect ensemble for his Emmy outing. &nbsp; View this post on Instagram &nbsp; A post shared by Vir Das (@virdas) After receiving an overwhelming response, Das chose the Delhi-based label Salooka by fashion designer Shubhangi Bajpai. The name of her label comes from stories of undivided Hindustan she grew up hearing, while the word itself is the name for the post-colonial vests worn by men in the northern belt of India. Creating Vir Das's Emmy look Bajpai recalled the initial phase of her creation process for the standup comic's outfit with excitement, \"It honestly started when one of my friends shared his post, claiming he is inviting designers to make his Emmy's outfit. Now, this is something that Vir has done before but for something like the Emmy's? Unbelievable.\" The NIFT Delhi (National Institute of Fashion Technology) graduate perfectly emulated the Call Me Bae actor's brief by borrowing elements from the undivided India, with hints of English tailoring. According to Vir's post on Instagram, Bajpai was selected from a vast list of 4000 applicants. Explaining the ensemble, Bajpai expressed how the attire was woven together from across India, \"the fabric for the shirt came from Hyderabad, while the chikankari embroidered on it was done in Lucknow. The suit fabric came in from Bombay while the lining was sourced from Gujarat. The process sp",
    "description2": "anned four states, with countless hands contributing to its creation.\" When asked about the challenges of creating such an ensemble in just a week, the designer recalled how she thought Das may have selected someone else for the role. \"When I was sketching the design, it was a very relaxed atmosphere, there was music playing in the background. It was already November and I knew the Emmy Awards were on the 25th of November. Naturally, I thought I had not been shortlisted. So when I heard from the team, I thought, 'How am I going to do this?' Because the silhouette was experimental, the sourcing was tricky and there was embroidery also. I was really anxious but so excited. It made me feel alive,\" Bajpai revealed. &nbsp; View this post on Instagram &nbsp; A post shared by Salooka (@salookalife) For the final outfit, Bajpai suggested a sophisticated look: a crisp single-button tailored jacket and a pleated lungi-inspired pair of pants (made in fine wool suiting), along with a new take on the cummerbund, which included a button closure. In the contemporary era, \"the modern man is on the go. So I wanted to create something that was not as tedious as tying a traditional lungi and that is how the cummerband was made. It was for the ease of putting on the outfit, with one button.\" she added. Describing the process, Bajpai told indianexpress.com, \"I think it was destined to happen this way, all over India, like Vir wanted. From the chikankari done in Lucknow to the fabrics from Hyderabad, Delhi, Gujarat, and Jaipur. I truly believe that Vir did carry a little bit of India to the Emmy's; he truly manifested it.\" Mannat is an intern at indianexpress.com",

    "description1": "Tadka with hing and jeera is one of those special touches that elevate even the simplest of Indian dishes. Popular for adding a burst of tang and flavour to our regular old dal, tadka- or the practice of tempering dates back centuries, with our mothers and grandmothers figuring out this master stroke of bringing out some extra taste along with some added nutrition. But what exactly makes hing and jeera the popular choices for tempering? Indianexpress.com spoke to health experts and found out. What does Ayurveda say? According to the traditional holistic medicine system of Ayurveda, the benefits of Jeera (cumin) and Hing (asafoetida) are myriad and essential to one's well-being. \"The word jeera itself comes from jeernam which means digestion, and jeera is thus used heavily for promoting gut health. Hing, which came to India from its native Afghanistan, is even more renowned for its action in promoting gut health,\" said Dr Biju KS, Senior Medical Officer, Vieroots. He shared that both spices are renowned for their anti-diabetic, weight loss, calming, anti-worm and microbiome-enhancing effects. \"Cooking them in ghee brings out their best effects and taste, as ghee is the perfect carrier in Ayurveda,\" he said. And what does science sa",
    "description2": "y? According to G Sushma, Clinical Dietician, CARE Hospitals, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, both the spices are well versed for their flavour enhancement properties when added as tadka. \"While hing is often used to mimic the taste of garlic and onions, making it a valuable spice in vegetarian dishes or for those who avoid these ingredients, jeera adds a warm, earthy flavor with a hint of bitterness,\" she said. Sushma said that hing is known for its ability to reduce bloating, gas, and other digestive issues. It helps stimulate the production of digestive enzymes and reduces inflammation in the body. \"Hing is used in traditional medicine to relieve respiratory conditions like asthma and bronchitis. Some studies suggest that cumin may help in controlling blood sugar levels, making it beneficial for people with diabetes,\" she said. According to her, jeera stimulates the secretion of digestive enzymes, which helps in better digestion and absorption of nutrients. It also helps in relieving bloating and gas. \"Cumin seeds are packed with antioxidants, which help fight free radicals in the body and reduce oxidative stress. These seeds also contain iron and other nutrients that are essential for maintaining a healthy immune system,\" she added.",

    "description1": "Dogs don’t always warm up to new furry companions. This reality became all too familiar to actor Kaley Cuoco, who recently opened up about having to rehome her beloved dog, Shirley, due to aggression issues with Blue, her fiancé Tom Pelphrey's dog. &nbsp; View this post on Instagram &nbsp; A post shared by Kaley Cuoco (@kaleycuoco) &nbsp; In an emotional homage to Shirley, Cuoco shared the \"difficult decision\" she had to make for the well-being of both pets. Talking about Shirley in an Instagram reel, Cuoco said the dog was eventually placed in a loving home where she thrived until she passed away at the age of 14 due to aggressive bone cancer. Reminiscing their bond, Cuoco described Shirley as a very “special” dog. Cuoco's experience sheds light on the complexity of canine aggression and the tough choices it may necessitate. To better understand this issue and explore solutions, we spoke with J S Rama Krishna, business head at Carniwel. Understanding aggression in dogs Krishna told indianexpress.com that aggression is often a dog’s way of expressing unmet emotional needs, unless it stems from a medical issue requiring veterinary intervention. “The more important question for me is, ‘What is my dog communicating, and how can I help?’ My first instinct is to ensure I’m not brushing aside an issue that my dog needs me to pay attention to,\" he said.Dogs, unlike humans, may prefer a more solitary lifestyle and might guard their space against perceived intruders, like mailmen, gardeners, and in some cases, other dogs. \"Dogs can be more selective towards their canine companions, and may not be eager to meet a canine crowd,\" he said. However, according to Krishna, dogs can be trained to coexist peacefully. “Socialising d",
    "description2": "ogs requires a structured and compassionate approach,” Krishna said, stressing the importance of proper introductions, especially in multi-dog households. He advised against punitive training methods. \"Maintaining and enforcing clear rules, with kindness, in your training regime will help. Some of these rules may look like no jumping, no begging, etc. Stay confident in your communication with the dogs, but also make sure that each canine gets separate time for attention from you. Also ensure that each dog in the household has access to resources like food, water, and toys,\" Krishna said. He also said, \"Introduce your dog to guests slowly in a controlled environment. Positive reinforcement, such as rewarding calm behavior with high-value treats, can help the dog associate guests with positive experiences. Keep treats at the door and let visitors offer them, helping to build trust.\" If aggression persists, consulting a certified animal behaviourist can help uncover triggers and develop tailored training plans. A dog's aggression, whether it is towards humans or other canines, can be rooted in a variety of causes. But the good news is that with the right training and socialisation, the behaviour can be improved. When rehoming becomes necessary Rehoming should be the last resort, implemented only after all other interventions fail. “In rare cases where a dog’s aggression remains uncontrollable despite consistent training and behaviour modification efforts, rehoming to a suitable environment where their needs and limitations can be managed responsibly may be the best solution,” he said. It’s essential to make such decisions under expert guidance to ensure the safety and well-being of both the dog and those around them.",

    "description1": "\n\n\nLausanne [Switzerland], November 27 (ANI): As we age, our cognitive and motor functions degrade, reducing our independence and overall quality of life. Research efforts to mitigate or perhaps eliminate this have resulted in technologies that hold a lot of promise.\nNow, scientists led by Friedhelm Hummel at EPFL have identified an important factor affecting an individual's responsiveness to atDCS. The team looked at how native learning abilities determine the effect of brain stimulation applied while learning a motor task. Their findings suggest that individuals with less efficient learning mechanisms benefit more from stimulation, while those with optimal learning strategies might experience negative effects.\n\nAmong these is non-invasive brain stimulation: a term encompassing a set of techniques that can affect brain functions externally and noninvasively, without the need for surgery or implants. One such promising technique, in particular, is anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS), which uses a constant, low electrical current delivered via electrodes on the scalp to modulate neuronal activity.\nHowever, studies exploring atDCS have produced inconsistent results, which has prompted researchers to explore why some people benefit from atDCS while others don't. The problem seems to lie in our understanding of factors that may influence responsiveness to brain stimulation, leading to responders and non-responders; among these, age has been suggested as one important factor.\nSome studies suggest further factors such as baseline behavioural abilities and previous training might be important considerations, but an interplay of these factors with behaviour has not been determined in detail, pointing to the need of refined predictive models of the effects of atDCS.\nThe researchers recruited 40 participants: 20 middle-aged adults (50-65 years old) and 20 older adults (over 65). Each group was further divided into those receiving active atDCS and those receiving placebo stimulation.\n\n\nOver ten days, participants practised a finger-tapping task designed to study motor sequence learning at home while receiving atDCS. The task involved replicating a numerical sequence using a keypad, trying to",
    "description2": " be as fast and as accurate as possible.\nThe team then used a machine-learning model trained on a public dataset to classify participants as either \"optimal\" or \"suboptimal\" learners, based on their initial performance. This model aimed to predict who would benefit from atDCS, based on their ability to integrate information about the task efficiently early during training\nThe study found that suboptimal learners, who were seemingly less efficient at internalizing the task at the early stages of learning, experienced an accelerated accuracy improvement while performing the task when receiving atDCS. This effect was not limited to people of a certain age (e.g., older adults), with suboptimal learners being found among younger individuals as well.\nIn contrast, participants with optimal learning strategies, regardless of age, even showed a negative trend in performance when receiving atDCS. This difference suggests that brain stimulation is more beneficial for individuals who initially struggle with motor tasks. As such, atDCS seems to possess a restorative rather than an enhancing quality, with important implications for rehabilitation.\n\"By leveraging different methods in Machine learning, we were able to untangle the influence of different factors on the individual effects of brain stimulation,\" said Pablo Maceira, the study's first author. \"This will pave the way to maximize the effects of brain stimulation in individual subjects and patients.\"\nThe study implies that, in the long run, personalized brain stimulation protocols will be developed to maximize benefits based on an individual's specific needs, rather than a common trait such as age. This approach could lead to more effective brain stimulation-based interventions, targeting specific mechanisms supporting learning, especially in the view of neurorehabilitation, for which the main basis is the re-learning of lost skills due to a brain lesion (e.g., after a stroke or a traumatic brain injury).\n\"In the future, clinicians could apply a more advanced version of our algorithm to determine whether a patient will benefit from a brain stimulation-based therapy, to enhance the effects of neurorehabilitation and personalize treatment,\" said Hummel.(ANI)\n",

    "description1": "\n\n\nNew York [US], November 26 (ANI): Laboratory experiments with cancer cells reveal two ways in which tumors evade drugs designed to starve and kill them, a new study shows. While chemotherapy successfully treats tumours and extends patients' lives, it is known that they do not work for everyone for long, since cancer cells rewire the mechanism by which they transform fuel into energy (metabolism) in order to avoid the treatments' effects. Many of these medications are so-called antimetabolics, which disrupt cell processes necessary for tumour growth and survival.\nLed by researchers at NYU Langone Health and its Perlmutter Cancer Center, the new study shows how cancer cells survive in an environment made hostile by the persistent shortage of the energy from glucose (the chemical term for blood sugar) needed to drive tumor growth. This better understanding of how cancer cells evade the drugs' attempts to kill them in a low-glucose environment, the researchers say, could lead to the design of better or more effective combination therapies.\n\nThree such drugs used in the study -- raltitrexed, N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA), and brequinar -- work to prevent cancer cells from making pyrimidines, molecules that are an essential component to genetic letter codes, or nucleotides, that make up RNA and DNA. Cancer cells must have access to pyrimidine supplies to produce more cancer cells and to produce uridine nucleotides, a primary fuel source for cancer cells as they rapidly reproduce, grow, and die. Disrupting the fast-paced but fragile pyrimidine synthesis pathways, as some chemotherapies are designed to do, can rapidly starve cancer cells and spontaneously lead to them dying (apoptosis).\nStudy results showed that the low-glucose environment inhabited by cancer cells, or tumor microenvironment, stalls cancer cell consumption of existing uridine nucleotide stores, making the chemotherapies less effective.\nNormally, uridine nucleotides would be made and consumed to help make the genetic letter codes and fuel cell metabolism. But when DNA and RNA construction is blocked by these chemotherapies, so too is the consumption of uridine nucleotide pools, the researchers found, as glucose is needed to change one form of uridine, UTP, into another usable form, UDP-glucose. The irony, researchers say, is that a low-glucose tumor microenvironment is in turn slowing down cellular consumption of uridine nucleotides and presumably slowing down rates of cell death. Researchers say cancer cells need to run out of pyrimidine building blocks, including uridine nucleotides, before the cells will self-destruct.\n\n\nIn other experiments, low-glucose tumor microenvironments were al",
    "description2": "so unable to activate two proteins, BAX and BAK, sitting on the surface of mitochondria, a cell's fuel generator. Activation of these trigger proteins disintegrates the mitochondria, and instantly sets off a series of caspase enzymes that help initiate apoptosis (cell death).\n\"Our study shows how cancer cells manage to offset the impact of low-glucose tumor microenvironments, and how these changes in cancer cell metabolism minimize chemotherapy's effectiveness,\" said study lead investigator Minwoo Nam, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Pathology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and Perlmutter Cancer Center.\n\"Our results explain what has until now been unclear about how the altered metabolism of the tumor microenvironment impacts chemotherapy: low glucose slows down the consumption and exhaustion of uridine nucleotides needed to fuel cancer cell growth and hinders resulting apoptosis, or death, in cancer cells,\" said senior study investigator Richard Possemato, PhD. Possemato is an associate professor in the Department of Pathology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and also a member of Perlmutter Cancer Center.\nPossemato, who is also coleader of the Cancer Cell Biology Program at Perlmutter, says his team's study results could one day be used to develop chemotherapies or combination therapies that would change or trick cancer cells into responding the same way in a low-glucose microenvironment as they would in an otherwise stable glucose microenvironment.\nHe also says that diagnostic tests could be developed to measure how a patient's cancer cells would most likely respond to low-glucose microenvironments and to predict how well a patient might respond to a particular chemotherapy.\nPossemato says his team has plans to investigate how blocking other cancer cell pathways might trigger apoptosis in response to these chemotherapies. Some experimental drugs, such as Chk-1 and ATR inhibitors, already exist that might accomplish this, he notes, but more need to be investigated because Chk-1 and ATR inhibitors are not well tolerated by patients.\nFor the study, researchers performed a scan of 3,000 cancer cell genes known to be involved in cell metabolism to determine, by deletion, which were necessary for cancer cell survival after chemotherapy. Most of the genes they found that were essential to cell survival in low-glucose tumor environments were also involved in pyrimidine synthesis, a precise biological pathway targeted by many chemotherapies. This focused their experiments on how different lab-grown clones of cancer cells responded to low-glucose after chemotherapy and what other chemical processes were impacted by depressed sugar levels.

    "description1": "\n\n\nToronto [Canada], November 15 (ANI): Researchers at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) revealed that stress alters how our brain encodes and retrieves aversive memories, and they developed a potential new method for restoring adequate memory specificity in persons suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nIf you stumble during a presentation, you might feel stressed the next time you have to present because your brain associates your next presentation with that one poor and aversive experience. This type of stress is tied to one memory. But stress from traumatic events like violence or generalized anxiety disorder can spread far beyond the original event, known as stress-induced aversive memory generalization, where fireworks or car backfires can trigger seemingly unrelated fearful memories and derail your entire day. In the case of PTSD, it can cause much greater negative consequences.\n\nIn a study published in Cell, Drs. Sheena Josselyn and Paul Frankland, Senior Scientists in the Neurosciences & Mental Health program, identify the biological processes behind stress-induced aversive memory generalization and highlight an intervention which could help restore appropriate memory specificity for people with PTSD.\n\"A little bit of stress is good, it's what gets you up in the morning when your alarm goes off, but too much stress can be debilitating,\" says Josselyn, who holds a Canada Research Chair in Circuit Basis of Memory. \"We know that people with PTSD show fearful responses to safe situations or environments, and have found a way to limit this fearful response to specific situations and potentially reduce the harmful effects of PTSD.\"\nTogether with their colleague Dr. Matthew Hill at the University of Calgary Hotchkiss Brain Institute, the research team was able to block endocannabinoid receptors on interneurons, and limit stress-induced aversive memory generalization to the specific, appropriate memory.\n\n\nIn a preclinical model, the research team exposed subjects to an acute, but safe, stress before an aversive event to create a non-specific fearful memory that could be triggered by unrelated safe situations, similar to how PTSD presents in humans.\nThe team then examined the subject's ",
    "description2": "memory engrams, which are physical representations of a memory in the brain pioneered by the Josselyn and Frankland labs at SickKids. Usually, engrams are made up of a sparse number of neurons, but the stress-induced memory engrams involved significantly more neurons. These larger engrams produced generalized fearful memories that were retrieved even in safe situations.\nWhen they looked closer at these large engrams, the study found that stress caused an increase in the release of endocannabinoids (endogenous cannabinoids) which disrupted the function of interneurons, whose role is it to constrain the size of the engram.\nThe endocannabinoid system enhances memory formation and helps link lived experiences with specific behavioural outcomes. In the amygdala, the emotional processing centre of the brain, certain 'gate keeper' interneurons have special receptors for endocannabinoids, and help constrain the size of the engram and the specificity of the memory. But, when too many endocannabinoids are released, the function of the gatekeeping interneurons is disrupted, causing an increase in the size of the engram.\n\"Endocannabinoid receptors function like a velvet rope at an exclusive club. When stress induces the release of too many endocannabinoids, the velvet rope falls, causing more generalized aversive fearful memories to form,\" explains Josselyn. \"By blocking these endocannabinoid receptors just on these specific interneurons, we could essentially prevent one of the most debilitating symptoms of PTSD.\"\nIn 2023, previous research in Science identified larger, more generalized memory engrams in the developing brain than in the adult brain, just like stress-induced memory engrams. As they continue to explore this unexpected link between engram size, stress and age, the teams are also delving into how daily stressors may impact happy memories.\n\"The many biological functions and processes that make up the complexity of human memory are still being uncovered,\" says Frankland, who holds a Canada Research Chair in Cognitive Neurobiology. \"We hope that as we better understand human memory, we can inform real-world therapies for those with various psychiatric and other brain disorders throughout their lifespan.\" (ANI)\n",

    "description1": "\n\n\nUppsala [Sweden], November 11 (ANI): Researchers at Uppsala University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology have created an antibody that has the potential to treat a variety of cancers. Researchers were able to integrate three different functionalities in the antibody, which combined significantly increased the action of T cells on the cancer tumour.\nResearchers have developed a unique type of antibody that both targets and delivers a drug package via the antibody itself, while simultaneously activating the immune system (\"3-in-1 design\") for personalised immunotherapy treatments.\n\n\"We have been researching precision medicine for close to 15 years now, as well as how we can use antibodies to influence an important key protein (CD40) in the immune system. We can now show that our new antibody method works as precision medicine for cancer,\" explains Sara Mangsbo, professor at the Department of Pharmacy at Uppsala University, who together with Johan Rockberg, professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, is the study's lead author.\n\n\nThe drug redirects the immune system to find and target specific mutations and gene changes that are only found in cancer cells, known as neoantigens. This is achieved by the new antibody both delivering the unique tumour-specific material directly to a particular type of immune cell and by stimulating this cell simultaneously, which then has the capacity to greatly enhance the T-cell response to the tumour.\nThe results show that the method works in several ways",
    "description2": ". Not only does it activate the right type of immune cells in human blood samples, but animal models show that mice receiving the treatment had prolonged survival and, at higher doses, also save the mice from cancer, and that the method is safer than previous cancer treatments the researchers have studied.\nCustomised precision medicines can be both costly and time-consuming to develop.\n\"The advantage of our drug is that it is easy to produce on a larger scale , yet can be easily tailored to the patient's disease or specific tumour. The medicine consists of two parts that are combined, a targeting bispecific antibody - which can be produced in large quantities in advance - and a custom peptide part, which is produced rapidly synthetically on a small scale for a desired type of cancer. Both in terms of production cost and the short time it takes to tailor a peptide to a new tumour, this increases availability and should make it quicker for patients to go from diagnosis to treatment,\" explains Johan Rockberg, Professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.\nThe aim of the study was to establish a more flexible, faster and safer treatment for cancer than those currently available. The study has already shown that the method has the potential to be customised for each patient, thereby strengthening the immune system against cancer. The next step is to use the fully optimised production process to manufacture the drug candidate for further safety studies and then start clinical trials in humans. (ANI)\n",

    "description1": "\n\n\nTrondheim [Norway], November 5 (ANI): Women with polycystic ovary syndrome, also known as PCOS and obesity are more likely to have smaller babies in terms of birth weight, length, and head circumference, according to a recent study from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).\nPCOS is a hormonal illness that affects one out of every eight women. Male sex hormone levels are often increased, menstrual periods are inconsistent or rare, and tiny cysts grow on the ovaries.\n\nIn the study, 390 children born to women with PCOS were compared with about 70,000 children from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).\nThe researchers discovered that, on average, kids born to moms with PCOS weighed less, were shorter, and had a smaller head circumference. This was especially true for obese moms, who had a BMI of 30 or above.\n\"In women of normal weight who have PCOS, we only find that their children have a lower birth weight compared to women who do not have PCOS. It is the group of children born to mothers with obesity that stands out the most. These babies have lower weight, shorter stature and a smaller head circumference. Obesity places an additional burden on mothers who have PCOS and their children,\" said Professor Eszter Vanky at NTNU's Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine.\nPCOS is a disease that follows women throughout their lives and can trigger various metabolic diseases and challenges such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity. Women with PCOS are generally more likely to develop overweight and obesity.\n\"What is unusual is that women who are generally overweight and gain a lot of weight during pregnancy usually have an increased risk of giving birth to large babies. This also applies to women who develop gestational diabetes. On average, women with PCOS have higher BMIs, gain more weight during pregnancy, and 25 per cent of them develop gestational diabetes. However, the outcome is the opposite: these women give birth to babies who are smaller than average. We still don't know why, but we see that the placenta is affected in these women,\" said Vanky.\nThe newly qualified doctors Maren Talmo and Ingvild Floysand have carried out the study as their master's thesis, with Eszter Vanky and Melanie Rae Simpson as their supervisors. Talmo explains that even though the placenta in these women is smaller in size, it seems to deliver more nutrients relative to the baby's body we",
    "description2": "ight compared to a normal placenta. Vanky describes it as a placenta in overdrive.\n\"The placenta delivers nutrients to the baby through the umbilical cord. In women with PCOS, we see that the placenta is generally smaller in size. At the same time, it must provide everything the baby needs, so it has to work very hard to meet these demands. Sometimes, however, the placenta can't keep up, which can lead to placental insufficiency and, in rare cases, foetal death.\"\n\n\nThe researchers do not know why this is the case.\n\"There are many hypotheses, but I don't think anyone has a definitive answer yet. Previously, we thought the cause was linked to the high levels of male sex hormones, but we have not been able to fully connect the two. We also know that women with PCOS have a slightly different immune profile during pregnancy.\"\nThe researchers believe this is important knowledge both for the women affected and for healthcare professionals.\n\"A newborn baby is not a blank slate. Much of our long-term health is established in the womb. Genes play a role, but also what we are exposed to during the foetal stage and early in life,\" said Vanky.\nThe NTNU researchers now want to learn more about what happens to the children's health.\n\"What are the consequences of the mother's PCOS diagnosis for the child? Is there anything that can be done before or during pregnancy so that expectant mothers with PCOS do not gain too much weight? Can follow up and good glucose regulation be provided so that the child gets the best outcome possible? All this depends on knowing more about the mother's situation,\" said Vanky.\nThe NTNU researchers have also followed up on some of the children when they reached the age of 7 years.\n\"We saw that the children born to mothers with PCOS generally had more central obesity, meaning they were larger around the waist,\" said Vanky.\nOther studies have shown that children born to mothers with PCOS are at higher risk of developing overweight and obesity at a young age. Research has also shown that low birth weight is linked to the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life.\n\"We see differences in children as early as 7 or 8 years old, where children born to mothers with PCOS have a larger waist circumference and higher BMI. They bear small signs that their mother has PCOS. It may therefore be an advantage to know about this so we can provide guidance on lifestyle and diet,\" said Vanky. (ANI)\n",

    "description1": "\n\n\nNew York [US], November 1 (ANI): The study, led by Patrizia Casaccia, founding director of the Advanced Science Research Centre at the CUNY Graduate Center's (CUNY ASRC) Neuroscience Initiative and Einstein Professor of Biology and Biochemistry at the CUNY Graduate Centre, investigated how enzymes known as ceramide synthase 5 and 6 are responsible for the toxic effect of a palm oil-rich diet on neurones in the central nervous system, which leads to an increase in the severity of MS symptoms.\nMS is an inflammatory autoimmune disease marked by extensive damage to the insulating myelin sheath that protects nerves throughout the body. Current treatments focus on controlling the immune system's response, but the precise mechanisms contributing to neurodegeneration in MS remain poorly understood. Previous work from the Casaccia lab and others had reported on the toxic effect of a high-fat diet on the severity of MS symptoms. In their study, researchers explored potential mechanisms by which a diet rich in palm oil may hijack neuronal health.\n\nUsing the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of inflammatory demyelination, the research team found that diets high in palm oil led to a more severe disease course in mice.\n\n\n\"We reasoned that inside neuronal cells, palm oil is converted into a toxic substance called C16 ceramide by specific enzymes called CerS5 and CerS6,\" said principal investigator Casaccia. \"This ceramide is responsible for inflicting mitochondrial damage, which d",
    "description2": "eprives neurons of the energy they need to counteract inflammation in the brain. We therefore asked whether inactivation of these enzymes would confer neuroprotection.\"\nThe researchers found that when they genetically deleted the enzymes CerS6 and CerS5 in neurons they could prevent neurodegeneration in the experimental model of MS.\n\"This held true even when mice were fed a diet rich in palmitic acid,\" said the paper's co-first author Damien Marechal, a research associate with the Casaccia Lab. \"This new information points to a specific metabolic pathway through which dietary fats can worsen MS symptoms.\"\nThe paper's findings have significant implications for individuals diagnosed with MS as well as for clinicians treating patients and neuroscientists researching the disease. The work reinforces that lifestyle choices, such as diet, can have a profound impact on the course of the disease. The study's results build on previous concepts about careful dietary choices in managing the symptoms of MS. The findings also identify potential molecules that could help slow diet-induced symptom severity.\n\"Our research provides a molecular explanation for how to protect neurons from the palm-oil-dependent creation of molecules that harm them,\" said Casaccia. \"We hope this information can empower patients to make informed dietary decisions that could positively impact the course of the disease, while identifying strategies to counteract the effect of cerS5 and CerS6 in a neuron-specific fashion.\" (ANI)\n",

    "description1": "When a woman marries, she doesn’t just form a relationship with her husband but also builds new connections with his entire family. These bonds can range from beautiful, with open arms and acceptance, to challenging and complex. However, no matter the situation, her husband's family becomes a significant part of her life, right? So, the question arises: how can she maintain these relationships while being respectful and also achieving her goals- - be it their love, respect, or a special place in their hearts?Here, five women share their real-life experiences of facing challenges with their in-laws. They reveal how they refused to give up, tackled the issues with smart strategies, and eventually transformed these relationships into beautiful bonds over time. 115864961Priya and her sister-in-law Priya from Bengaluru was often judged by her sister-in-law, Neha, for focusing on her job. How she dealt with it: Priya politely explained to Neha how she balanced work and family, and not just solely focused on her job. Priya explained to her how she understands the importance of a good work-life balance. Neha started to understand her better and became supportive when she saw her working hard in both her personal and professional life. Priya also made an effort to involve Neha in family activities, which helped their relationship improve. Eventually, they grew closer and started respecting each other’s choices more.Aditi and her mother-in-law 115864974 Aditi from Delhi had a controlling mother-in-law who always criticized her. How she dealt with it: Aditi spoke to her husband, Arjun, who slowly and politely helped set boundaries with his mom. Aditi also learned to stay calm and choose which issues to address. Over time, things got better, and her mother-in-law st",

She understood that consistent efforts would make her relationship better, and it did. Sanya and her father-in-lawSanya from Mumbai felt immense hurt because her father-in-law, Mr. Rao, compared her to his previous daughter-in-law. How she dealt with it: Sanya calmly spoke to Mr. Rao and explained how his words made her feel. While not immediately, he slowly understood and became more respectful. Over time, their relationship became less tense, and Mr. Rao stopped comparing her to others. Sanya also worked on building a more comfortable atmosphere by staying patient and understanding. She understood and gave her father-in-law proper time and space while also working towards making their relationship better. 115864979Neha and her mother-in-lawNeha from Kolkata was often criticized by her traditional and somewhat orthodox mother-in-law for not doing all the household work. How she dealt with it: Neha spoke to her husband, Raghav, and they divided the work fairly. She also gently set boundaries with her mother-in-law. Over time, her mother-in-law understood and respected her decisions more. Neha made sure to express gratitude for her mother-in-law’s help, which softened the relationship.Simran and her in-lawsSimran from Chandigarh felt immensely overwhelmed by her in-laws who kept interfering in her life personal life.How she dealt with it: Simran spoke openly to her in-laws and told them she needed space. With her husband’s help, they set clear boundaries. Simran was firm but polite, and her in-laws started respecting her more. She also made time for family activities to maintain good relationships despite the boundaries.",

    "description1": "Relationship dynamics have long interested experts and the public at large. There have been many debates and studies on the subject. Quite often people are left questioning if there is a difference between women and men predicting a better relationship outcome. A new research appearing in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships has given this topic a brand new perspective. Done by Matthew D. Johnson, professor of family science at the University of Alberta, this research predicts just how well men and women make up romantic relationships. With 314 unmarried mixed-gender couples participating in his four-year study, he provides insight that clashes with, but further refines, our long-standing assumptions.  115706962 Traditionally, it has been believed that women have a sort of \"sixth sense\" in regard to relationships: they notice problems sooner and take steps toward resolution or separation when necessary. Social psychological theories would argue that societal norms force women to take greater responsibility for maintaining a relationship, which makes them more sensitive to their perception that a relationship is failing. Evolutionary theorists further argue that the greater biological investment of women in producing offspring makes them more eager to see that their relationships perform with l",
    "description2": "ong-run goals.However, this new study contradicts this concept. The research highlights that women are better at predicting breakups only in the area of commitment. If a woman's commitment decreases, then it strongly predicts a break up within two, three, and four years. However, this predictive power does not extend to other aspects of the relationship such as satisfaction and love. 115706967The study revealed that men's and women's judgments of love and marital satisfaction were equal, in determining relationship outcomes. This appears to break a stereotype that women are better predictors of relationship success just because of their gender. Instead, it is noticed that though women can easily sense and react to changing commitments levels in their relationships, perceptions of love and satisfaction on the part of both partners plays an equally important role for the longevity of their relationship.The study highlights the complexity of dynamics in relationships and suggests that the hypothesis that the women are \"relationship experts\", is overstated. Instead, both men and women play significant roles in predicting and affecting the direction of the future of their relationships, and their perceptions are of equal importance to understanding relationship outcomes. 115728981 115846006 115779903 115706108",

    "description1": "So often, we are told to annihilate our ego, kill our ego or destroy your ego but can one do these? Can one destroy their ego, which is their identity? Ego is the one that identifies as ‘I’, ‘my’ and ‘mine’. From the time we are born, till the time we are gone, it is the ego that identifies us with our body. We say, ‘I am Ravi,’ ‘This is my car,’ and ‘These properties are mine.’ What gives rise to such feelings of possession and thereby, such statements? It is our ego. Unfortunately, because of the ego, we become unhappy. It is the ego that creates the seven monsters of our life - anger, hate revenge, jealousy, pride, greed and selfishness. It is because of the ego that our Happiness dissolves and disappears. Therefore, if we want to be happy, we must eliminate our ego but we can't. We must let go of the ego but we can't. We can’t because ego is our basic identity from the birth to the death of our body and that stays with us until the death of our body. So, there is only one solution to solve the arrogance of the ego and do away with the seven monsters associated with it – We must work towards Enlightening of our Ego. What is Enlightening of Ego? Enlightening is Awakening of the Ego, realizing that I am not ‘I’. Of course, I am but ‘Who am I?’ It is realizing that I am not the body that will die. This body came much later but I was conceived and alive 9 months before the body came into being in the form of a zygote. Then, this zygote formed into an embryo and was delivered on this earth. One day, this body will grow old and die and people will either cremate or bury it. All this happens because I am not the body. I am the one that was alive in the body. People will say that I passed away because I would have left the body. I am that Spark Of Unique Life, the Soul. When I realize that I am the Soul, I will achieve my goal. I can live a life of Eternal Bliss living in the Truth Consciousness of who I am, in reality. Th",
    "description2": "erefore, we must remember that we cannot completely let go of our ego. We will retain some parts of it but we can for sure, Awaken the Ego and Enlighten the Ego. When there is a true Realization of, ‘Who am I?’ In that very moment, there is Liberation from the misery, sorrow and the seven monsters of the ego. Then, we experience a state of Eternal Bliss. Everlasting Happiness has a numerator as there are many ways to be happy. True Happiness has 3Ps representing the three ascending peaks of Happiness namely-- pleasure, peace and purpose. Most of us are caught in pleasure because the Mind and the Ego, ME, wants to feel or rather become happy. Because we are trying to become happy, we are not happy. Happiness is a state of ‘being’. We must ‘be happy’. How can we be happy? We can be happpy by realizing our true self, our true energy, our Divine self that is within. The moment we create a duality of ‘I’ and ‘you’, problems start. The Realization of non-duality is the way to Awaken and Enlighten our Ego, which is the way to Eternal Bliss and Everlasting Happiness. So, the next time we hear somebody saying, ‘Let go of the ego,’ remember that one can completely let go of the ego only in the moment of death. Only in the moment of death, the ego will go because we won't exist anymore but as long as we exist, the ego or the identity with the body will remain. A word of caution! One shouldn’t try to annihilate or kill the ego because one can't. And one shouldn’t even try to let go of the ego too. One must just realize the simple yet profound and life-transforming Truth of ‘Who am I, in reality.’ One must Awaken and Enlighten the Ego and in that light of the Truth, one will experience Eternal Peace, Divine Love and Everlasting Bliss. One will never cry because they have discovered the Truth of, ‘Who am I?’Authored by: AiR- Atman in Ravi, author, singer, philanthropist and happiness ambassador 115706960 115728981 115817558 71221211",

    "description1": "One of the easiest ways to maintain the shape of our body is to walk; it doesn't require any special equipment or a gym membership. The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention says that adults should participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week for optimal health. This may be 30 minutes of walking per day for 5 days a week, or whatever works best for a person's schedule. However, keep in mind that if done improperly, even this simple exercise may be less beneficial or even dangerous. These are some of the most frequent errors people make when walking, along with simple fixes.Walking while distracted Using your phone or watching videos while walking can compromise your posture, reduce awareness of your surroundings, and increase the risk of accidents. A study done in 2018 highlights how multitasking while walking impacts coordination and reduces the overall benefits of the activity. It suggests that smartphone use while walking can significantly decrease balance and changes a person's manner of walking which ultimately has negative effects on the body. Fix: Commit to a distraction-free walk. Keep the phone tucked away and focus on the posture and environment to ensure safety and maximize benefits. 115893195Wearing improper footwearBlisters, foot soreness, and even chronic problems can result from wearing the incorrect shoes. Your joints may be strained if your shoes don't have enough arch support or cushioning to absorb impact. It is always recommended and various studies also say that investing in comfortable, supportive footwear tail",
    "description2": "ored to your walking needs will eventually be fruitful to your health. Fix: Choose shoes that fit well, provide adequate support, and suit your walking style. Neglecting hydrationWalking, especially in warmer weather or for long durations, can lead to dehydration, which will of course in all cases impact the person's stamina and recovery. As per a study published, when the body lacks enough water, it struggles to maintain balance during challenges like illness, exercise, or exposure to extreme environments, which can negatively impact health and bodily functions. A lack of hydration diminishes blood flow and can make the walks feel more like a job that you definitely don't want to do any longer.Fix: Drink water before and after your walks. You can always carry a reusable water bottle to stay hydrated. 115893210Improper walking formDragging the feet or slouching while walking reduces efficiency and can lead to muscle strain or fatigue. Walking with poor form—such as leaning forward, not engaging your core, or failing to roll your feet properly—can also strain your back and knees.Fix: Maintain an upright posture with shoulders relaxed and back. Keep your gaze forward, engage your core, and ensure a smooth heel-to-toe motion.Ignoring postureYour walking posture directly affects your joints and muscles. A fumbled pattern of walking can cause discomfort and limit the efficacy of your walk. Incorrect posture also raises the chance of developing persistent neck or lower back discomfort.Fix: Maintain proper posture by standing tall, chest open, and arms naturally swinging at your sides.",

    "description1": "Walking, despite being a low impact workout, is an effective way to begin the day. Take short bouts, strides of walk in the morning nourishes the cognitive health in the right way. But what many people overlook is the diet following a long walk. You need to eat nutritious food right after finishing walk and there is no food better than a handful of almonds.A new study found regularly eating almonds may aid recovery after exercise by reducing pain and muscle damage, while improving muscle performance. Eating foods that help people recover from exercise by reducing muscle fatigue and soreness may help them better stick to their exercise routines. These new findings add to the growing body of scientific evidence exploring how almonds affect recovery after exercise. Prior studies investigated almonds’ effect on feelings of fatigue and exercise metabolism and explored the impact of eating almonds on feelings of soreness and muscle performance.In this new randomized, crossover study, published in Current Developments in Nutrition and funded by the Almond Board of California, 26 middle-aged adults who exercised one to four hours per week and were at a healthy weight or mildly overweight (body mass index (BMI) of 23-30) ate either two ounces (57g) of whole raw almonds or a calorie-matched (three ounces / 86g) of unsalted pretzels daily for eight weeks. After eight weeks of eating almonds or the control food with a four-week washout period between the two interventions, participants performed a 30-minute downhill treadmill run to induce muscle damage, then were immediately given their daily two-ounce (57g) serving of almonds or calorie-matched pretzels. Participants continued to eat daily servings of almonds or pretzels for three days after the treadmill run. Researchers measured participants’ perceived muscle soreness, muscle performance (assessed via a muscle contraction test and a vertical jump) and blood markers of muscle damage/inflammation (creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, myoglobin and antioxidant capacity) before the treadmill run and at 24, 48 and 72 hours after the run.The Results:During exercise recovery (up to 72 hours after the treadmill run), the almond group compared to control had: Lower creatine kinase (CK) levels - a marker of muscle damage.A quicker decline in CK levels after 72 hours, which may indicate a faster recovery rate.Better muscle performance at 24 and 72 hours. Modestly reduced pain ratings following maximal contraction at 24 (37% lower) and 48 hours (33% lower)There were no differences in other biochemical markers of muscle damage and inflammation (like C-reactive protein, myoglobin concentrations and total antioxidant capacity). This study tested non-smoking adults who exercised one to four hours per week and were at a healthy weight or were mildly overweight, so the results may not apply to people with other demographic and health characteristics. Future studies should also consider taking measurements over a longer recovery period. 115886323“Our study provides more insight into the role almonds may play in supporting fitness recovery,” said Dr. Mark Kern, PhD, RD, CSSD, professor of exercise and nutritional sciences at San Diego State University. \"Almonds contain a wide range of nutrients that we know supp",
    "description2": "ort exercise recovery including protein, antioxidants and phytonutrients. These nutrients are supplied in a whole food package versus isolated vitamin supplements which may contribute to the almond benefits observed in this study.\" One ounce (28 g) of almonds provides 6g of protein, 4g of fiber, 13g of unsaturated fat, only 1g of saturated fat, and 15 essential nutrients, including 77mg magnesium (18.3% DV), 210mg potassium (4% DV), and 7.27mg vitamin E (50% DV), making them a great snack for healthy active lifestyles. 112190969 115255436 “More research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind how almonds improve exercise recovery. Strategies to improve exercise recovery are important because if you are recovering better, you are likely to be able to train sooner—or harder—for subsequent workouts,” Dr. Kern said. Study Conclusion: Snacking on two ounces (57g) of almonds for eight weeks modestly reduced pain ratings, helped maintain muscle strength, and reduced muscle damage after exercise. Commenting of the newly published study, Nutrition and Wellness Consultant Sheela Krishnaswamy, said, “Almonds are a nutrient powerhouse, and the recent research highlights their role in possibly aiding muscle recovery in occasionally active healthy or mildly overweight adults. It shows that consuming two ounces of almonds daily for two months modestly reduced muscle soreness and damage in individuals who exercise occasionally. Participants experienced lower creatine kinase levels (a muscle damage marker), a quicker decline in creatine kinase levels which may indicate faster recovery, improved muscle performance, and less soreness even 72 hours post-exercise. This shows that almonds can may effectively reduce muscle pain, enhance strength, and support faster recovery, making them a valuable addition to the diet of occasionally active individuals.\" 104895442Rohini Patil, MBBS and Nutritionist, said, “The recent research highlights that consuming two ounces of almonds daily can significantly reduce muscle soreness, enhance recovery, and improve exercise performance. This small yet powerful nut is packed with essential nutrients such as protein, healthy fats, fiber, and important vitamins and minerals, making it an ideal addition to any fitness regimen. Regular almond intake helps minimize muscle pain, boost muscle strength, and promote quicker post-workout recovery, allowing you to come back stronger. By fueling your body and aiding faster recovery, almonds make an excellent companion for achieving your fitness goals.”Ritika Samaddar, Regional head, Department of Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics, Max Healthcare - New Delhi, said, “Almonds are a nutrient powerhouse, and the recent research highlights their role in aiding muscle recovery. It shows that consuming two ounces of almonds daily for two months significantly reduced muscle soreness and damage in individuals who exercise regularly. Participants experienced lower creatine kinase levels (a muscle damage marker), faster recovery, improved muscle performance, and less soreness even 72 hours post-exercise. This clearly shows that almonds can effectively reduce muscle pain, enhance strength, and support faster recovery, making them a valuable addition to the diet of active individuals.\" 115886339",

    "description1": "The Oxford University Press has named 'brain rot' as its Word of the Year. The selection of the Word of the Year is done on the basis of public voting, in which more than 37,000 people had participated this year. \"Our language experts created a shortlist of six words to reflect the moods and conversations that have helped shape the past year. After two weeks of public voting and widespread conversation, our experts came together to consider the public’s input, voting results, and our language data, before declaring ‘brain rot’ as the definitive Word of the Year for 2024,\" the official statement said. 115885139It defines brain rot as the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging. Also: something characterized as likely to lead to such deterioration.But what is it, exactly? \"Brain rot\" isn't an actual medical condition, -it's a colloquial term used to describe mental stagnation or cognitive decline resulting from too much consumption of nonproductive or overstimulating content, such as scrolling endlessly on social media or binge-watching shows.This term \"brain rot\" describes the actual sensation of mental exhaustion or numbing as a consequence of reading and watching pointless material. Try to imagine wasting several hours browsing randomly through YouTube videos or checking out Instagram Reels without any sense of purpose. This appears innocuous enough, but all such wasted time adds up over time and can gradually contribute to cognitive fatigue and decline in one's ability to concentrate, think, and meaningfully interact with the world. 115885143This \"rotting\" isn't literal, of course—there’s no actual decay in the brain. Instead, it’s about how overexposure to low-quality or repetitive stimuli can limit your intellectual growth and emotional well-being. When the brain isn’t challenged with constructive activities, it can lose its sharpness, much like how a muscle weakens if not exercised. 115485932\"Our experts noticed that ‘brain rot’ gained new prominence this year as a term used to capture concerns about the impact of consuming excessive amounts of low-quality online content, especially on social media. The term increased in usage frequency by 230% between 2023 and 2024,\" the Oxford University Press said.Why brain rot needs to be assessed properl",
    "description2": "yMental health thrives on balance—balancing productivity and rest, stimulation and calm, consumption and creation. Brain rot disrupts this balance, and its effects can be far-reaching. Constant exposure to fast media can overstimulate your brain, which might lead to a feeling of stress. Social media platforms, particularly, thrive on endless feeds, which may create anxiety from comparisons, FOMO, or negativity exposure. The constant change of content often conditions the brain to crave instant gratification, making it challenging to hold one's attention for a longer period of time.10 effective brain exercises to start the day withOver time, this contributes to a lack of productivity, further fueling feelings of frustration or inadequacy. Too much low-quality content can desensitize you emotionally. The overabundance of memes or trivial content can leave you feeling unfulfilled, even though you’ve spent hours consuming it. Late-night scrolling sessions can wreak havoc on your sleep hygiene. Poor sleep directly impacts mental health, leading to issues such as depression, irritability, and fatigue.How to address the concept of brain rotThe concept of \"brain rot\" serves as a wake-up call in a world overflowing with distractions. By addressing this phenomenon, you can improve your cognitive function but also nurture your overall mental health. First of all, track your digital habits. Most smartphones contain built-in tools that measure how much time you spend in different applications. Identify what occupies most of your time and evaluate if it adds value to your life. For instance, do you get inspired by scrolling through Instagram, or does it drain you?Creative activities would combat the passive nature of mere mindless consumption. In addition to scrolling through social media, one can attempt to write, draw, cook, or learn something new. Creative pursuits are good for the brain and self-esteem. 115353281Be choosy about what you consume. Instead of consuming garbage, make sure to consume stuff that nourishes your mind: watch documentaries, listen to podcasts, or read books. If you like social media, follow inspiring or educational accounts rather than comparison-oriented ones.Mindfulness techniques help train the brain to stay present, countering the overstimulation caused by excessive media consumption. Simple practices like deep breathing, journaling, or yoga can make a big difference in re-centering your mind.",

    "description1": "Oil plays a central role in maintaining overall health and is mostly linked directly with heart health. When it comes to maintaining a healthy heart, most people think of changing their cooking oil first. The oil that we consume can have a beneficial effect or a detrimental effect on the body depending on its properties.Among the various cooking oils available, olive oil and mustard oil stand out for their potential cardiovascular benefits. Both oils have unique nutritional properties, but their suitability for heart health depends on their composition, the type of cuisine, and how they are used. Olive oil has anti-inflammatory propertiesOlive oil is extracted from olives and is a staple in Mediterranean cuisine. It is renowned for being rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), particularly oleic acid, which is known to lower bad cholesterol (LDL) levels while maintaining or even boosting good cholesterol (HDL). Olive oil also contains powerful antioxidants like polyphenols and vitamin E, which help reduce inflammation, a critical factor in heart disease.Olive oil linked to low amounts of bad cholesterol in bloodResearchers from the University of Florida found that following a extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) diet resulted in lowered amounts of ‘bad’ cholesterol in the bloodstream. The study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that dietary changes resulted in lower cardiovascular risk factors compared with baseline levels, with a greater difference in optimal directions following the transition to a l",
    "description2": "ow EVOO diet, suggesting that EVOO may not be the beneficial additive of a Mediterranean Diet. 115215721Mustard oil has fatty acids that can prevent blood clotsMustard oil, derived from mustard seeds, is commonly used in Indian cooking. It has a distinctive pungent flavor and is rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, as well as omega-6 fatty acids. These essential fatty acids are vital for reducing triglycerides and preventing blood clots, which can lower the risk of heart disease. Mustard oil also contains natural antioxidants and exhibits anti-inflammatory properties.Another notable feature of mustard oil is its high smoke point, making it suitable for high-temperature cooking methods like frying, which are prevalent in Indian cuisine. However, mustard oil contains erucic acid, which, in excessive amounts, has been debated for its potential adverse health effects. The presence of erucic acid in mustard oil has raised concerns regarding its cardiovascular safety, prompting regulatory scrutiny and public debate.Which one of these oils is heart-friendly?The best source for those seeking better heart health benefits is olive oil. It is suitable for low heat, cooking as it can be used for dressings and dips or even as a simple addition to a Mediterranean-style diet. Meanwhile, mustard oil holds cultural relevance and practicality for households in India as it has a high smoke point and is suitable for Indian cooking. It affords unique benefits, particularly to those who consume traditional Indian diets.ReplyForward",
