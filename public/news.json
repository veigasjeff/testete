    "description1": "Violence has been ongoing in the region after gunmen opened fire on convoys carrying Shia pilgrims on November 21.\nSectarian violence continued in Pakistan’s northwest over the weekend, killing at least 14 people and wounding 27 in the past 24 hours in the Kurram district, located in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province near the border with Afghanistan.\nThis brings the death toll from fighting over the last 10 days to at least 130, with 200 people wounded, according to officials on Sunday.\nViolence has escalated in the region since November 21, when gunmen opened fire on convoys carrying Shia pilgrims. The attack killed 52 people, including women and children.\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the assault.\nKurram is the only district in Pakistan where Shia make up the majority of the population, in contrast to the rest of the country, where Sunnis are the majority. Waves of violence have been unfolding since July, when tensions between Shia and Sunni tribes flared over a land dispute.\nThe Pakistani government has made efforts to ease tensions. On November 24, government officials brokered a seven-day ceasefire, but it failed to hold.\nThis ",
    "description2": "week’s death toll marks a significant escalation. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that 79 people were killed between July and October due to sectarian violence.\nJaved Ullah Mehsud, Kurram’s deputy commissioner, said talks are under way with tribal elders to negotiate a new ceasefire, and that security personnel have been deployed to enforce peace.\nThe closure of the main highway connecting the city of Parachinar with the provincial capital Peshawar has resulted in shortages of basic necessities like food, fuel, and medicine.\nDespite the violence, Mehsud said authorities have restored internet and mobile services in the area.\nThe fighting comes amid an already tense period in Pakistan, as violence surges across the country.\nIn addition to the Shia-Sunni clashes in Kurram, at least 245 people have been killed in attacks and clashes nationwide in November, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), an Islamabad-based think tank.\nThe report found that 127 of the victims were members of armed groups, 68 were security personnel, and 50 were civilians.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "The ICC prosecutor promises that more applications will be forthcoming as the Rohingya seek justice and accountability.\nThe prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has requested an international arrest warrant for the military ruler of Myanmar for the persecution of Rohingya.\nThe office of prosecutor Karim Khan said on Wednesday that Min Aung Hlaing, chief of the military government that took control of the country in a coup in 2021, is responsible for crimes against humanity regarding the treatment of the Rohingya minority.\nThe prosecutor’s office has been investigating alleged crimes committed during 2016-17 violence in the country’s state of Rakhine for the past five years, it said.\nAt that time, the Myanmar military unleashed a brutal crackdown on Rohingya civilians, sending at least 700,000 fleeing into neighbouring Bangladesh amid reports of killings, torture, rape and arson.\nMilitary chief Min Aung Hlaing “bears criminal responsibility for the crimes against humanity of deportation and persecution of the Rohingya, committed in Myanmar, and in part in Bangladesh”, the prosecutor’s office said.\n“My Office alleges that these crimes were committed between 25 August 2017 and 31 December 2017 by the armed forces of Myanmar, the Tatmadaw, supported by the national police, the border guard police, as well as non-Rohingya civilians,” Khan’s statement said.\n#ICC Prosecutor @KarimKhanQC addresses the Rohingya community on the application for a warrant of arrest in the situation in #Bangladesh/#Myanmar ⤵️https://t.co/OyQHr9q29r pic.twitter.com/vYSJdSNQKe\n— Int'l Criminal Court (@IntlCrimCourt) November 27, 2024\nThe work of the ICC seeks to vindicate the resilience of the mainly Muslim minority community of Rohingya – more than a million of whom were forcibly displaced by military action – and “their hope in the power of the law”, the prosecutor added.\nZin Mar Aung, foreign minister for Myanmar’s opposition National Unity Government, established by elected lawmakers barred from taking their seats in 2021, said on X that ICC judges should “swiftly issue the warrant” and that governments should “act and enforce this warrant to uphold justice and int",
    "description2": "ernational law.”\nMyanmar’s military government in a statement rejected the proceedings, noting it was not party to the ICC and insisting the country’s leadership practiced a policy of “peaceful coexistence.”\nThe judges at the ICC will now determine whether the application can warrant an arrest order. The process could take several months.\nTurmoil has been building in Myanmar ever since the coup. Armed factions have fought the military government and have gradually scored victories, especially in areas near the border with China.\nThat has stirred tension with Beijing, a major arms supplier to the military government and Myanmar’s biggest trade partner. Analysts note that China also maintains ties with the ethnic armed groups which hold territory along the border.\nEarlier this month, Min Aung Hlaing embarked on his first visit to China since seizing power, with Beijing reportedly unhappy with his failure to ensure stability and halt criminality.\nUnited Nations investigators said the military campaign against the Rohingya, which involved mass killings, rapes and destruction, was carried out with “genocidal intent”. Myanmar rejects the charges.\nThis was the first application for an arrest warrant against a high-level Myanmar official issued by the ICC. The prosecutor, who was speaking from a refugee camp in Bangladesh, promised “more will follow”.\n“In doing so, we will be demonstrating, together with all of our partners, that the Rohingya have not been forgotten. That they, like all people around the world, are entitled to the protection of the law,” the British-born barrister said.\nIn 2022, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the highest court of the UN, advanced a separate case against Myanmar, brought by The Gambia, that investigates responsibility for genocide against the Rohingya.\nFive European powers and Canada last year joined the ICJ case against Myanmar, arguing they seek to “make a contribution to clarifying and combating genocide”.\nThe request for an arrest warrant on Wednesday comes shortly after the ICC issued international arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders, six months after the prosecutor sought them.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "As the threat from plastic pollution mounts, countries could only agree to postpone negotiations to a later date.\nCountries negotiating a global treaty to curb plastic pollution have failed to reach an agreement, with more than 100 nations advocating for a cap on plastic production and a handful of oil-producing countries only willing to target plastic waste.\nThe fifth United Nations Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5) meeting in Busan, South Korea was intended to be the final session. It was hoped the meeting would produce a legally binding global treaty.\nIf successful, it would have marked the most significant global climate pledge since the Paris Climate Accords in 2015, but the group of nations could only agree on Sunday to postpone negotiations to a later date.\nSaudi Arabia, in particular, was accused of standing in the way. The country strongly opposed efforts to reduce plastic production and used procedural tactics to delay progress.\n“It is clear that there is still persistent divergence,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, told the Reuters news agency.\nOne plan that received significant international support was proposed by Panama on Thursday. If adopted, it would have established a pathway for a global production reduction target, but it did not specify what that target would look like. Another proposal did not mention produc",
    "description2": "tion caps at all.\nPanama’s delegation head, Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez, lambasted the postponement of negotiations.\n“Every day of delay is a day against humanity,” he said. “Postponing negotiations does not postpone the crisis.”\nBased on current trends, plastic production is on track to triple by 2050.\n“Every day that governments allow polluters to continue flooding the world with plastic, we all pay the price. This delay comes with dire consequences for people and the planet, ruthlessly sacrificing those on the front lines of this crisis,” Graham Forbes, Greenpeace’s delegation head to the global plastics treaty, said in a statement.\n“This week, over 100 member states, representing billions of people, rejected a toothless deal that would have accomplished nothing and stood before the world committing to an ambitious treaty. Now, it’s time they stand by this promise and deliver.”\nThe environmental group GAIA told Reuters that “there is little assurance that the next INC will succeed where INC-5 did not”.\nThe postponement comes just days after the turbulent conclusion of the 29th UN Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan.\nAt COP29, countries pledged $300bn annually to address climate change. However, this plan fell far short of the $1.3 trillion requested by developing nations, which are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "South Korea could step back from aiding Kyiv, a proposal that was spurred by the North’s deployment to Russia.\nA laser beam downs drones by heating up and “frying” their electronics – each invisible, soundless “shot” is more precise and less costly than an air defence missile.\nHanwha Aerospace, a South Korean defence company, has fire-tested and is about to start mass-producing the world’s first-ever optical fibre laser weapon.\nAnd Hanwha is ready to supply it to Ukraine if Seoul lifts a ban on the export of lethal weapons to Kyiv “in light of North Korean military activities”, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said in late October.\nHis statement followed North Korea’s deployment of about 10,000 soldiers to western Russia, becoming the first foreign power to step into the Russia-Ukrainian war.\nHowever, the US president-elect may stand in the way.\nDonald Trump and his fledgling administration members have repeatedly said that they want to limit US military aid to Ukraine – or even stop it altogether.\nSeoul may have to follow suit, two South Korean officials told Bloomberg on Thursday.\nHowever, a member of the Ukrainian delegation that visited Seoul earlier this month doubts it.\n“I don’t think they will refuse. They seemed rather independent and self-sufficient in their diplomatic and military politics,” Roman Bochkala, co-founder of a Ukrainian charity fund that delivers arms and other crucial supplies to the front line, told Al Jazeera.\n“It’s paramount to [South] Korea to maximally compensate for the potential danger of real combat experience the North Korean army might get,” he said.\nAnother Ukrainian analyst agreed – but said that Seoul may not sell other lethal weaponry to Kyiv.\n“Such [weaponry] will most likely not be limited, but we will have to pay for it,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. “But Seoul will hardly make artillery shells for us. And won’t send any tanks.”\nSouth Korea has reportedly supplied hundreds of thousands of artillery shells via the United States and pledged a $2.3bn low-interest loan to Kyiv.\nSeoul is the world’s 10th-largest arms exporter, and its clients already include four nations that border Russia – Poland, Estonia, Finland and Norway.\nBut Kyiv may be the first to receive the lasers in what could significantly knock down the price of Ukraine’s air defence.\n“[South] Koreans swear that their laser will fry enemy drones with an almost 100 percent guarantee, destroying engines or other electronic equipment within 10-20 seconds,” Bochkala said.\nThe South Korean systems will supplement Patriots, advanced air defence systems that cost $1bn each and need $4m missiles that are often spent on downing Russia’s $50,000 drones.\nThe laser needs nothing but electricity – and could be deployed to the Ukrainian cities that have no Patriots or similar Western or Taiwanese air defence systems.\n“There are never too many good friends. And South Korea may become one for Ukraine,” Bochkala said.\nIn early August, Ukrainian forces seized a chunk of Russia’s westernmost Kursk region – and have held on to most of it.\nKyiv hoped that Moscow would deploy troops from the front lines of the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas to repel the surpri",

Now, they’re volunteering in droves, because the motherland is in danger,” a Moscow resident told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.\nBut it took the Kremlin weeks to start the counteroffensive as it kept on pushing in Donbas, taking several crucial towns and villages.\nNorth Korean soldiers joined the fray earlier this month, according to Western and Ukrainian intelligence and officials.\n“It significantly boosts the enemy’s potential,” Lieutenant-General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera.\nHowever, Moscow decided not to concentrate the North Koreans in one place instead deploying small groups to Russian units.\n“They are not collected in one fist, which would have been more effective had there been a [North Korean] division or a brigade,” Romanenko said.\nWith some 1.3 million servicemen and millions of reservists, North Korea has one of the world’s largest armies.\nIt is armed with Soviet-era weaponry or its domestically produced replicas.\nAnd though the Kursk deployment may look sensational, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in fact “mirrors” what a South Korean leader did half a century ago, according to analyst Kushch.\nBetween 1964 and 1973, when South Korea was poorer and less industrialised than the pro-Communist North, South Korean President Park Chong-hee deployed some 350,000 soldiers to Washington’s war Vietnam – along with tens of thousands of workers.\nIn exchange, he secured multibillion-dollar US investments, credits and technology transfers that helped turn South Korea into one of the world’s most technologically advanced and affluent nations.\nVietnam accused South Koreans of war crimes, but Park paid no heed as the economic boom helped him cement his grip on power.\nKim Jong Un is equally unceremonious as Moscow props his nation’s economy with billions of dollars paid for arms and ammunition, discounted supplies of energy, food and technologies.\nKim’s Kursk deployment may become a powerful bargaining chip in the ceasefire talks with President-elect Donald Trump’s future administration.\n“Putin will reserve a Korean trump card up his sleeve before future talks with Trump – or for the final attack in the Kursk region that for now seems to be maximally delayed,” Kushch said.\nEarlier this week, Ukrainian troops in Kursk repelled a massive Russian advance and reported first losses among North Koreans.\nThe deployment may look like Putin’s weakness amid reports of a dire shortage of manpower, but the consensus in Russia is: “Let them fight instead of us,” according to Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Kyiv-based Penta think tank.\nMeanwhile, the rapprochement between Moscow and Pyongyang likely irks Beijing, North Korea’s main backer, according to Fesenko.\n“North Korea is eluding China’s monopolistic influence, and Russia’s clout in Beijing’s own back yard is on the rise,” he told Al Jazeera.\nThere is also a significant risk of escalation on the Korean Peninsula as “after battle-testing his troops in a real war, Kim may get excited by the smell of blood,” Fesenko said.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description2": ".\nLi’s predecessor, Wei Fenghe, was also kicked out of the party and passed on to prosecutors for alleged corruption.\nA Communist Party statement at the time said the pair “betrayed the trust of the party and the Central Military Commission, seriously polluted the political environment of the military, and caused great damage to … the image of its senior leaders”.\nThey were found to have received huge sums of money in bribes and to have “sought personnel benefits” for others, the statement said.\nAccording to experts, this is a blow to the party and the role.\n“It’s certainly a blow … because one would imagine they will be super careful to have someone very clean in this role,” Dylan Loh, an assistant professor at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, told the AFP news agency.\n“Graft probes are very commonly targeted at the military because of the long historical ties between the business world and the PLA,” he said.\nAt least two other high-ranking officers connected to the Rocket Force, a relatively new unit of the Chinese military, have also been removed for corruption.\nVictor Shih, an expert on China’s elite politics, told AFP that Dong “likely had authority over tens of billions in procurement per year” during his time in the navy.\n“The problem is that competition for top positions is so fierce that there might be some mutual recriminations between officers, which would lead to endless cycles of arrests, new appointments and recriminations,” he said.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Former Israeli army chief and defence minister says northern Gaza is being ‘cleared of Arabs’, echoing ICC allegations.\nFormer Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon has accused Israel of committing war crimes and ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip, echoing the allegations by the International Criminal Court against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant.\nYaalon, a former army chief of staff, told Israeli media that hardliners in Netanyahu’s far-right cabinet were looking to chase Palestinians from northern Gaza and wanted to re-establish Jewish settlements there.\n“I am compelled to warn about what is happening there and is being concealed from us,” Yaalon told public broadcaster Kan on Sunday.\n“At the end of the day, war crimes are being committed.”\nIn an interview with the private DemocratTV channel, Yaalon said, “The road we are being led down is conquest, annexation and ethnic cleansing.”\nPressed on the “ethnic cleansing” appraisal, he said: “What is happening there? There is no more Beit Lahiya, no more Beit Hanoon, the army intervenes in Jabalia and in reality, the land is being cleared of Arabs.”\nYaalon served as defence minister under Netanyahu from 2013 to 2016 and has been a fierce critic of the prime minister ever since.\nNetanyahu’s Likud party accused him of spreading “slanderous lies”, while Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, head of a small rightist party, said his accusations were baseless.\nThe ICC last month issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict.\nPalestinians have long accused Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing in Gaza during the ongoing conflict.\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, Palestinian-American historian Rashid Khalidi, the Edward Said professor emeritus ",
    "description2": "of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, said the “genocide” happening in Gaza since October 2023 is “worse than any phase of Palestinian history”.\nIn recent weeks, the Israeli military has intensified attacks on northern Gaza, saying they are targeting Hamas fighters who have regrouped, forcing civilians to flee the area. United Nations agencies say Palestinians are suffering from more than a month of military siege in the north.\nOn Thursday, Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf visited the Gaza border and backed an initiative to re-establish settlements in the enclave.\n“Jewish settlement here is the answer to the terrible [October 7, 2023] massacre and the answer to the International Criminal Court in The Hague,” Goldknopf was quoted as saying in Israeli media.\nMost world powers deem settlements built in territory Israel seized in the 1967 war as illegal and see their expansion as an obstacle to peace, since they eat away at land the Palestinians want for a future state.\nOn Sunday, leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) reiterated their calls for an “immediate and permanent” ceasefire in Gaza during their meeting in Kuwait.\nThe leaders “condemned in the strongest terms the shocking and horrific crimes committed by Israeli occupation forces in the Gaza Strip as part of a genocide and ethnic cleansing agenda” against Palestinians.\nThey also welcomed the ICC arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant.\nAs negotiations continue for an elusive ceasefire, Israeli forces struck Beit Lahyia on Monday, killing at least 10 more Palestinians.\nIsrael’s genocide in Gaza has killed at least 44,429 Palestinians and wounded 105,250 since October 7, 2023. At least 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks that day, and more than 200 were taken captive.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Boulos is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter Tiffany and led campaign outreach to Arab and Muslim Americans.\nUnited States President-elect Donald Trump has selected Lebanon-born billionaire Massad Boulos as his senior White House adviser for Arab and Middle Eastern affairs, citing the businessman’s outreach to Arab Americans during the election campaign.\nThe announcement of the appointment on Sunday comes as the Trump administration continues to take shape, particularly in terms of the officials who will oversee US policy in the Middle East, although the purview of Boulos’s role was not immediately clear.\nBefore the selection of Boulos, who is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter Tiffany, the president-elect tapped pro-Israel hawk Marco Rubio as his nominee for secretary of state; Mike Huckabee, a staunch supporter of illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, as his ambassador to Israel; and friend Steven Witkoff, a businessman with scant policy experience, as special envoy to the Middle East.\nIn a statement on Trump’s Truth Social platform, the president-elect hailed Boulos as “an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the International scene”.\n“Massad is a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East. He will be a strong advocate for the United States, and its interests, and I am pleased to have him on our team!” Trump wrote.\nBoulos was a key figure in the Trump campaign’s outreach to the Arab American community and sought to capitalise on outrage over President Joe Biden’s continued support for Israel during the war in Gaza and, more recently, Israel’s invasion of Lebanon.\nIt was a difficult balancing act. Trump had repeatedly promised to end the war in Gaza and prevent further escalation but had long been the preferred candidate of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government.\nDuring his first term from 2017 to 2021, Trump had fully embraced Israel, moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, long seen as the capital of a future Palestinian state; recognising Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights in Syria; forging a series of normalisation agreements between Israel and Arab countries; and allowing for the rapid expansion of Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.\nHis selection of Huckabee",
    "description2": " – an evangelical Christian minister who in 2008 said there is “no such thing as a Palestinian” – has signalled the makings of a similarly permissive approach in his second term.\nBoulos also sought to calm concerns over Trump’s 2017 bans on travellers from several Muslim-majority countries, a swiftly reversed executive order seen as blatantly discriminatory.\nBoulos’s efforts received mixed marks from leaders in the large Arab American community in Michigan, a key battleground state.\nSome embraced Trump, identifying with his socially conservative message or just seeking to punish Biden, while others derided Boulos for failing to give specifics about how Trump would chart a different path than Biden in the region.\nStill, the election saw a historic shift away from Democrats from within Arab American and Muslim American communities.\nIn Dearborn, the largest Arab American majority city in the US, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris received just half of the votes that Biden had in 2020. All told, the vice president won just over 36 percent of the vote in the city with Trump taking more than 42 percent and Jill Stein, the Green Party’s candidate, carrying 18 percent.\nFor his part, Boulos has been largely silent on his personal views on the Middle East and has not articulated his own policy positions.\nHe was born to a politically connected Christian family in Lebanon but moved to Texas as a teenager and eventually joined his family’s business ventures in Nigeria.\nWhile The Associated Press news agency had previously reported that Boulos ran for parliament in Lebanon in 2009, he disputed that account in a recent interview with Newsweek.\nHe also pushed back that he was “a friend” of Suleiman Frangieh, a Lebanese politician with ties to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad whose presidential ambitions have been backed by the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.\nBoulos instead said he was not affiliated with any party in Lebanon but remained “acquainted with most Lebanese Christian leaders”.\nThe businessman has described himself as a longtime Republican who supported Trump in 2016. He came more firmly into Trump’s orbit after his son Michael married Trump’s daughter Tiffany.\nHis selection was announced a day after Trump said he would nominate Charles Kushner, the father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, as the US ambassador to France.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

Syrian state television said Russia was providing Syria’s military with air support.\nBy Saturday, images and videos began circulating online showing rebel fighters taking photos next to the ancient Citadel of Aleppo as they advanced through the city.\nAfter capturing Aleppo, the rebels advanced south, but there are conflicting reports about whether they have reached the central city of Hama.\nThe opposition announced an effort to expand safe areas and allow displaced civilians in Idlib to return to their homes in recently “liberated” territories.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Suspension of humanitarian aid into Gaza comes as Israeli attacks kill almost 100 Palestinians in the last 24 hours.\nThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees has halted the delivery of aid through the Karem Abu Salem (known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis) crossing between Israel and Gaza because of security concerns, its chief said, as widespread hunger and deadly Israeli bombardments continue.\n“We are pausing the delivery of aid through Kerem Shalom, the main crossing point for humanitarian aid into Gaza. The road out of this crossing has not been safe for months. On 16 November, a large convoy of aid trucks was stolen by armed gangs,” UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said in a post on X.\n“Yesterday, we tried to bring in a few food trucks on the same route. They were all taken,” he added, warning hunger was “rapidly deepening” in Gaza.\nLazzarini listed how the humanitarian operation had become “unnecessarily impossible” due to “the ongoing siege, hurdles from Israeli authorities, political decisions to restrict the amounts of aid, lack of safety on aid routes and targeting of local police”.\nHe called on Israel to ensure aid flowed to Gaza and said the country “must refrain from attacks on humanitarian workers”.\nOn Thursday, the UN agency said “out of the 91 attempts the agency has made to deliver aid to besieged north Gaza between October 6 and November 25, 82 have been denied and 9 impeded.”\nIsrael has been accused of using starvation as a weapon of war as it has restricted supplies of food, medicine and other essential items into Gaza since launching the war last October. More than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed in nonstop Israeli bombardment since then.\nLouise Wateridge, the UNRWA emergency officer, told Al Jazeera that the targeting of aid convoys has been happening since May.\n“That has led to desperation of people, who don’t have what they need and it has led and forced criminal activities,” she stressed.\nThe pause in the delivery of aid also follows an Israeli attack o",

The Israeli military claimed one of the contractors was involved in Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack.\nHowever, the WCK said it had “no knowledge that any individual in the vehicle had alleged ties” to the Hamas attack.\nThe UN said last month that 333 aid workers had been killed since the start of the war in October of last year, 243 of them employees of UNRWA.\nIsrael, which imposed a total siege on Gaza in the early stages of the war last year, blames the inability of relief organisations to handle and distribute large quantities of aid.\nHamas’s Interior Ministry in Gaza have responded to the looting, saying more than 20 of the gang members suspected of carrying out the robbery had been killed by its security forces acting in coordination with tribal committees.\nMeanwhile, Palestinians in Gaza have told Al Jazeera of their confusion over how, in one of the most heavily surveilled territories on the planet, the presence of so many armed men could have gone undetected by Israeli forces.\nThe Washington Post had previously reported that an internal UN memo from October said the gangs in Gaza “may be benefitting from a passive if not active benevolence” or “protection” from the Israeli army.\nOne gang leader, the memo said, had established a “military-like compound” in an area “restricted, controlled and patrolled by the IDF (Israeli army)”.\nAs this developed, Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that nearly 100 people were killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza in the last 24 hours.\nThe casualties include those killed in an Israeli strike on a home belonging to the al-Araj family in the Tal az-Zaatar neighbourhood, which housed more than 40 people.\nIsrael’s genocide in Gaza has killed at least 44,382 Palestinians and wounded 105,142 since October 7, 2023.

    "description1": "Demonstrations spread across the country over ruling party’s path away from EU membership, shift towards Russia.\nDemonstrators in Georgia have taken to the streets for a fourth night in growing protests against the government’s decision to suspend talks on joining the European Union.\nThe protests on Sunday topped months of tensions fuelled by critics of the ruling Georgian Dream party, which some charge has moved the country away from its path towards greater integration with Europe and instead towards Russia.\nThe unrest kicked into overdrive after the government last week announced it would freeze EU talks for four years. Protesters have further condemned the police response – which has included the use of tear gas and water cannon – as excessive.\nOn Sunday, the outrage was further stoked by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze’s rejection of appeals to hold new parliamentary elections.\nWhen asked if the vote would be held again, he told reporters: “Of course not.”\nHe added that “the formation of the new government based on the October 26 parliamentary elections has been completed.”\nStill, the opposition continues to condemn the vote. President Salome Zurabishvili, who supports joining the EU, has asked the Constitutional Court to annul the election results and declared the new legislature and government “illegitimate”.\nSpeaking to the AFP news agency on Saturday, Zurabishvili, whose term ends this month, said she would not step aside until the elections are rerun.\nGeorgian Dream has nominated far-right former football international Mikheil Kavelashvili for the presidential post, which is largely ceremonial.\nOn Sunday, protesters again gathered in the capital, Tbilisi, predominantly on the central Rustaveli Avenue, with many waving EU and Georgian flags. Some wore diving masks to protect themselves against tear gas.\nBut the demonstrations appeared to be spreading as Georgian media reported protests in at least eight cities and towns.\nIn the Black Sea city of Poti, protesters blocked an access road to the country’s main commercial port, according to the Interpress news agency.\nOpposition TV channel Formula also showed footage of people in Kh",

Usually this sort of thing ends very badly.”\nGeorgia has leaned strongly towards Europe and the West since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Its move away from Moscow was hastened by a brief war with Russia in 2008.\nLast year, it became an official candidate for EU membership and has been promised eventual NATO membership.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Social Democratic Alliance wins the largest share of votes but will need to form a coalition to govern.\nIceland’s centre-left Social Democratic Alliance has won the most votes in snap elections prompted by the collapse of the coalition in power for the past seven years, the final count shows.\nThe Social Democrats won 15 seats in the 63-seat parliament, the Althingi, with 20.8 percent of the votes, state broadcaster RUV reported on Sunday.\nThe conservative Independence Party, which led the outgoing government, won 14 seats with a 19.4 percent vote share, and the centrist Liberal Reform Party won 11 seats and 15.8 percent of the votes. Three other parties also won seats.\nIcelanders voted on Saturday after disagreements over immigration, energy policy and the economy forced Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson to pull the plug on his coalition government and call early elections.\nThis weekend’s results more than doubled the share the Social Democrats won in the previous election in 2021.\n“I’m extremely proud of all the work that we’ve done. We obviously see that people want to see changes in the political landscape,” Social Democratic leader Kristrun Mjoll Frostadottir said as results started coming in.\nFrostadottir, 36, will likely try to seek coalition partners to command a parliamentary majority.\n“It very much depends on whether she can convince the president that she is the most likely to be able to form a coalition,” Stefania Oskarsdottir, a political scientist at the University of Icelan",
    "description2": "d, told the Reuters news agency.\n“It seems that the Reform Party is critical in this because they have the option of joining a coalition with the Social Democrats and the People’s Party, and they also have the option of forming a coalition with the Independence Party and the Centre Party,” Oskarsdottir said.\nThe Pirate Party lost all of its seats in this election, meaning that only six parties will have seats in the new parliament.\nFrostadottir has pledged to address the country’s cost of living crisis, which has been caused by inflation and high borrowing costs – a challenge faced by countries worldwide in recent years and a thorn in the side of incumbent parties, including the Democrats in the United States.\nIn February 2023, inflation peaked at 10.4 percent in Iceland. While inflation slowed to 5.1 percent in October, it is still significantly higher than in much of the rest of the world.\nBy comparison, inflation in the US stood at 2.6 percent last month while the European Union’s rate was 2.3 percent\nPublic finances have also been strained by repeated volcanic eruptions in southwestern Iceland, which have displaced thousands of people. Migration has also been a key issue in this election, as Iceland struggles to accommodate asylum seekers.\nThe number of refugees seeking protection in Iceland jumped to more than 4,000 in each of the past three years, compared with a previous average of fewer than 1,000. Iceland has a population of fewer than 400,000 residents.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Russian and Syrian jets reportedly attack Idlib city on fifth day of opposition’s surprise advance in northwest Syria.\nSyrian opposition fighters say they are pushing towards the northern city of Hama after taking control of nearby Aleppo in a lightning offensive that started last week.\nThe attempted southern advance on Sunday comes on the fifth day of the surprise rebel offensive as Syrian and Russian forces have launched counterattacks, reportedly pounding opposition-controlled Idlib province and Aleppo with air attacks since Saturday.\nGovernment forces under the control of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have also been fortifying the northern province of Hama, according to the Syrian state news agency, SANA. It reported the army overnight pushed back opposition fighters in its northern countryside. Forces there were being resupplied with heavy equipment and rocket launchers, according to SANA.\nOn Sunday, United Nations special envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, appealed for all stakeholders in the conflict to immediately seek a political resolution.\n“The latest developments pose severe risks to civilians and have serious implications for regional and international peace and security,” he said.\nThe fighting marks the most significant turn in years in the Syrian war, which began with popular uprisings across the country in 2011. Since 2020, the front lines had largely been stagnant with an array of rebel groups largely contained to a small portion of Idlib province.\nBut on Friday, opposition fighters led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) entered Aleppo, prompting government forces to withdraw from the strategically significant city of more than 2 million people.\nThe opposition forces have since claimed several strategic victories, including taking control of the supply-line town of Khanasir, the Aleppo Industrial City, Aleppo’s military academy and the field artillery college.\nFormerly known as al-Nusra Front, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, HTS has distanced itself from the group while becoming the strongest opposition movement in northwestern Syria.\nIt is still considered a “terrorist” organisation by the United States, Syria and Russia.\nIn his first public comments since the start of the offensive, released late on Saturday, al-Assad said his forces would continue to defend the government’s “stability and territorial integrity against terrorists and their supporters”.\nHe said that Syria can defeat the opposition groups, no matter how much their a",
    "description2": "ttacks intensify.\nBut reporting from the Turkish-Syrian border, Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu said rebel forces remained on the outskirts of Hama and were “trying to counter the Syrian government forces there”.\n“The villages, towns that have been taken by the opposition, sometimes the Syrian government forces take them back,” she said. “So there is an exchange of [control]. Still, it’s very dynamic, very volatile on the ground.”\nThe government said the air strikes on opposition-controlled areas were targeting weapons depots and rebel strongholds.\nHowever, the United Kingdom-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Russian strikes hit camps for displaced people on Sunday, killing eight civilians and wounding 50.\nThe White Helmets, officially the Syrian Civil Defence, said that at least 25 people, including 10 children, had been killed in air strikes carried out by the Syrian government and Russia on Sunday.\nYears of war in Syria have created one of the world’s largest displacement crises with thousands more people reported displaced in the latest fighting.\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, Razan Saffour, a British-Syrian human rights activist with family in Aleppo, said that while there is relative stability in Aleppo, there is fear over the response from the government and Russian forces.\nRussia’s military intervention in the country, starting in 2015, as well as Iran’s two years earlier helped to turn the tide of the war in favour of al-Assad. Russia’s aerial bombardments of Aleppo then helped government forces take full control of the city in 2016.\n“We’re speaking about rebel groups who are gaining Syrian territory at a very, very fast pace, but at the same time, they don’t have air defences,” she said.\n“And when we’ve seen this happen [previously], … the al-Assad regime, Russia and their ally Iran responded with a scorched earth policy.”\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was to travel to Damascus on Sunday, telling reporters Tehran would back al-Assad.\nJordan’s King Abdullah II and United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan also expressed solidarity with al-Assad in recent calls with him.\nStill, Saffour said that beyond the confusion and fear, there is also a sense of anticipation among some residents of Aleppo who had lived for years under government control.\n“We’re very apprehensive, but we’re also very excited and very hopeful to see what’s going to come next,” she said.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "The proposal passed both houses of Mexico’s Congress, leading critics to fear weakened government transparency.\nAn evening vote in Mexico’s Senate to dismantle seven independent government watchdogs has ignited controversy, with the country’s political opposition accusing the governing Morena Party of violating democratic principles.\nOn Friday, the leader of the right-leaning Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) took to social media to express his outrage.\n“The elimination of these autonomous organisations represents a direct attack against the rights of Mexicans and even democracy itself,” Alejandro Moreno Cardenas, the PRI’s president, wrote.\nHe praised the seven watchdogs as “pillars of transparency and accountability that guaranteed to the people of Mexico access to clear information about the actions of the government”.\nHis comments came after Mexico’s Senate held a vote on Thursday to fold the seven oversight bodies into existing executive agencies, under Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum.\nSheinbaum and her fellow Morena Party members have described the reform as a chance to cut down on government bureaucracy and reduce spending.\nHowever, critics fear the dissolution of the watchdog agencies will make the government more vulnerable to corruption and weaken public confidence in Mexican democracy.\n“We will firmly defend the transparency and rights of our country. Mexico does not deserve to go backwards!” Moreno Cardenas said, accusing the Morena Party of an “authoritarian” streak.\nOne of the agencies in the crosshairs is Mexico’s Institute for Information Access and Transparency (INAI), which played a key role in pushing the government to release information about the 2014 Ayotzinapa case, which saw the kidnapping of 43 college students.\nMexico’s military had been implicated in the kidnapping, and the government investigation was marred by allegations of false evidence and coerced confessions.\nOther organisations earmarked for dissolution are the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE), the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) and the National Commission for the Continuing Improvement of Education (MEJOREDU).\nThe bill to disband these government bodies passed through the lower house of Mexico’s Congress, the Chamber of Deputies, last week after a tense debate. A total of 347 deputies voted in favour and 128 against.\nThe Senate on Thursday likewise advanced the measure, by a vote of 86 to 42.\nThe proposal now goes to the individual states to approve: Mexico has 31 states and one federal entity for the capital, Mexico City. At least 17 of their governments must back the measure for it to be successful.\nBut with a majority of state legislatures controlled by the Morena Party, the measure is likely to pass. Already, the state government of Zacatecas, as well as the government of Mexico City have approved the reforms.\nThe elimination of the seven watchdogs",
    "description2": " has been a longstanding priority of the Morena Party — and particularly its popular figurehead, former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.\nDuring his six-year term, which ended in September, Lopez Obrador repeatedly clashed with oversight agencies like INAI, accusing the body of wasteful spending, bloated salaries and political bias. He ultimately unveiled plans to dismantle INAI in 2021.\nHis successor Sheinbaum, a close political ally, has carried forward several of his key legislative priorities, including the plan to disband INAI.\nSpeaking at a morning news briefing, Sheinbaum defended the Morena Party’s push to fold the seven watchdogs, paying special mention to INAI.\n“There will be more transparency now. The dissolution of INAI as an autonomous body will end corruption and will develop a system of transparency where people can easily access information on everything the Mexican government does,” Sheinbaum said.\nBut media rights groups and government transparency organisations have denounced the move as a threat to Mexican democracy.\nEarlier this month, for instance, the Mexican Association for the Right to Information (AMEDI) issued a statement expressing its “rejection” of the proposal.\n“The technical autonomy and political independence of these bodies is a fundamental principle for the democratic functioning of our society,” AMEDI said.\n“Subordinating the functions of these bodies to the federal executive branch or related agencies increases the risk of politicisation and threatens the impartiality of decisions that affect all citizens.”\nFernando Nieto-Morales, a professor at the Colegio de Mexico, likewise called the move an erosion of “critical institutional checks and balances” in an article for the Wilson Center, a US-based think tank.\n“This impending constitutional reform represents a profound setback for Mexico’s democratic trajectory,” he wrote.\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, journalist and author Manu Ureste emphasised the importance of groups like INAI.\nHe and other journalists sent more than 500 freedom of information requests to INAI in recent years to expose a government embezzlement scandal, popularly known as the “master scam”, that used fake companies to launder public money.\n“Without this transparency tool, we would never have known about this ‘master scam’ or many other such cases. I think it is a key part of Mexican democracy,” Ureste said.\nThe fate of the millions of documents in INAI’s possession now remains unclear. Hours before the Senate’s vote, the head of INAI, Adrian Alcala, spoke to Al Jazeera’s Julia Galiano about the importance of his agency’s work.\n“There is nothing comparable to INAI in the world,” Alcala said.\n“Developed countries with advanced democracies look to the Mexican model when it comes to transparency. It is legally and institutionally robust. It’s been effective in bringing some order to this country and also in fighting corruption.”\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "‘Trump is back, and it’s a sign we’ll be back, too,’ Brazil’s ex-president tells WSJ amid coup attempt accusations.\nBrazil’s former President Jair Bolsonaro has expressed hope that United States President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January will help bolster his own political comeback, amid accusations that he took part in a failed coup in the South American nation.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported late on Thursday that Bolsonaro is banking on Trump pressuring Brazil with sanctions to delay enforcing a court ruling that bars him from office until 2030 for baselessly attacking the country’s voting system before the 2022 elections he lost.\n“Trump is back, and it’s a sign we’ll be back, too,” Bolsonaro said in an interview with the US newspaper.\nBolsonaro’s remarks come just days after Brazilian police released a report implicating the former president in an alleged criminal organisation designed to overturn the 2022 election that he lost to his left-wing rival, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\nBolsonaro “planned, acted and was directly and effectively aware of the actions of the criminal organisation aiming to launch a coup d’etat and eliminate the democratic rule of law”, the report said.\nThe former army captain, who served as president from 2019 to 2022, has denied any wrongdoing and claimed to be the victim of a politically motivated witch-hunt.\nDespite the coup accusations and other investigations against him, Trump’s electoral victory earlier this month in the US has injected new energy into Brazil’s far-right and stirred hopes that Bolsona",
    "description2": "ro can mirror his return to power.\nBolsonaro often expressed admiration for Trump during the Republican’s first term in office from 2017 to 2021, and he was widely dubbed “Trump of the Tropics” during his own presidency.\nSimilarly to Trump, who continues to say the 2020 election he lost to President Joe Biden was stolen from him, Bolsonaro spent months in the run-up to the 2022 vote in Brazil falsely claiming that the country’s voting system was vulnerable to widespread fraud.\nShortly after his left-wing challenger Lula took office in January 2023, thousands of Bolsonaro’s supporters who were angered over the election results stormed the presidential palace, Congress and the Supreme Court in the capital, Brasilia.\nThe attack drew comparisons to the insurrection in the US two years earlier, on January 6, 2021, when a group of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building in Washington, DC, to prevent Congress from certifying Biden’s election victory.\nGuilherme Casaroes, professor at the Fundacao Getulio Vargas’s Sao Paulo School of Business Administration, said this week that Brazilian conservatives “are hoping [Trump] will use the threat of sanctions and other punitive measures to put pressure on Brazilian authorities to allow” Bolsonaro to run for president in 2026.\n“Even if the threat of US sanctions doesn’t by itself change judicial outcomes in Brazil, a global chorus of sympathy for Bolsonaro may, in fact, help him politically in Brazil, fuelling a sense of grievance and popular desire for his return”, Casaroes wrote in Americas Quarterly.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Mexico emphasises interconnectedness of economic ties with US – and the mutual threat of tariffs.\nMexico’s president and economy minister have given the clearest picture yet of how their government will respond to United States President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on the country, which their government has warned will cost 400,000 US jobs.\nSpeaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said the Mexican response would be swift if Trump followed through on the plans.\n“If there are US tariffs, Mexico would also raise tariffs,” Sheinbaum said.\nThe comments were the latest response to Trump’s statement on Monday that he plans to impose massive tariffs not just on China, but on Canada and Mexico as well, at a whopping 25-percent rate.\nEconomy Minister Marcelo Ebrard also warned against Trump starting a regional trade war, calling the cost to US workers “huge”.\n“Around 400,000 jobs will be lost” in the US, he said, pointing to a study based on figures from US carmakers that manufacture in Mexico.\nHe added the impact would extend beyond workers to US consumers. For example, Ebrard said, most pick-up trucks sold in the US are manufactured in Mexico. He claimed Trump’s tariffs would add $3,000 to the cost of a new vehicle.\n“That is why we say that it would be a shot in the foot,” he said.\nTrump has promised to use tariffs to bolster the US manufacturing industry – an attempt at a hard reset that economists have cast doubt on.\nStill, the severity of the president-elect’s approach to Canada and Mexico, who along with China make up the US’s top three trading partners, has come as somewhat of a surprise.\nIn his statement on Monday, Trump said he would impose the 25-percent tariffs if the three countries do not do more to address irregular migration and drug smuggling into the US.\nSheinbaum had previously called the threats “unacceptable”.\nOn Wednesday, Sheinbaum revealed she held a call with Trump to discuss migration across the US-Mexico border, where ",
    "description2": "she attempted to assuage his fears.\n“I had an excellent conversation with President Donald Trump,” Sheinbaum posted on social media. “We discussed Mexico’s strategy on the migrant phenomenon, and I shared that caravans are not arriving at the northern border because they are being taken care of in Mexico.”\nOfficials have also warned Trump’s tariffs likely run afoul of the free trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada, the USMCA, which prohibits most duties on trade between the three countries.\nTrump himself had renegotiated the agreement during his first term, complaining that US businesses were getting a raw deal.\nSheinbaum has requested a meeting with Trump before he takes office on January 20.\nFor his part, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had already spoken with Trump about the tariff threat, stressing the longstanding ties between the two countries.\n“We talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together. It was a good call,” he said. “This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on, and that’s what we’ll do.”\nGovernment officials have not been the only ones who have warned of the impact of the proposed tariffs on US companies and consumers.\nAnalysts at Barclays have said they estimate the proposed tariffs “could wipe out effectively all profits” from the “Detroit Three” automakers: GM, Stellantis and Ford.\n“While it’s generally understood that a blanket 25 percent tariff on any vehicles or content from Mexico or Canada could be disruptive, investors under-appreciate how disruptive this could be,” they wrote in a note on Tuesday.\nTrump’s team, for its part, has remained defiant.\nBrian Hughes, a spokesperson for Trump’s transition team, told the Reuters news agency the tariffs would protect US manufacturers and workers from “unfair practices of foreign companies and foreign markets”.\nHe contended Trump would implement policies he said would make life affordable and more prosperous for the US.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "The US says its sanctions target 21 individuals involved in anti-democratic practices and the repression of protests.\nThe United States has announced sanctions against 21 allies of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, citing alleged involvement in the suppression of protests following a contested July election.\nOfficials with the US Department of the Treasury said on Wednesday that the harsh crackdown, in which at least 25 protesters were killed, was an effort to stifle dissent. More than 2,400 protesters were arrested during the demonstrations.\n“Maduro and his representatives’ repressive actions in the wake of the Venezuelan presidential election are a desperate attempt to silence the voices of its citizens,” Bradley Smith, the acting undersecretary of the Treasury Department, said in a statement.\nVenezuela, meanwhile, dismissed Wednesday’s sanctions as a “desperate act”.\nThe sanctions come months after a July 28 presidential election in which Maduro claimed victory, despite pre-election polling showing him losing by an insurmountable margin.\nWhen the election results were announced without the usual breakdown of votes, the opposition denounced the tally as fraudulent. It published copies of ballot sheets online that it said proved opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez won the race.\nInternational observers also questioned the election results. “Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election did not meet international standards of electoral integrity and cannot be considered democratic,” The Carter Center, a US-based nonprofit, wrote in a news release afterwards.\nLast week, the administration of US President Joe Biden recognised Gonzalez as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. It is unclear what effect that announcement, along with the new round of sanctions, will have on Venezuela.\nA separate news release from the US Depart",
    "description2": "ment of State said that the sanctions target “members of the security forces and cabinet-level officials” who “undermined a competitive and inclusive electoral process in Venezuela or are responsible for acts of repression”.\n“Maduro’s security apparatus has engaged in widespread abuses, including killings, repression and mass detention of protestors,” the State Department wrote.\nThe release also said that such sanctions have been applied to a total of 180 current and former Venezuelan officials, including today’s batch. Nearly 2,000 people face visa restrictions for their alleged role in the electoral repression as well.\nThe Maduro government has faced growing diplomatic isolation following the election, which awarded the bus-driver-turned-president a third term in office.\nSome leaders in the region, including Brazil’s Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva and Colombia’s Gustavo Petro, had previously expressed a desire for stronger ties with Venezuela. But both men have since cast doubt on the legitimacy of Maduro’s victory and called for the release of voting tallies that could confirm the government’s claims.\nMaduro’s government has yet to release such documentation.\nOther Latin American countries, including Peru, El Salvador and Argentina, have broken relations with Venezuela in the aftermath of the election.\nStill, Venezuela does maintain diplomatic relations with many of its neighbours in Latin America. On Wednesday, Uruguay’s President-elect Yamandu Orsi indicated he would maintain ties with Maduro’s government, even though he too previously called the election results “more than suspicious”.\nThe opposition candidate Gonzalez, meanwhile, left Venezuela after the government issued a warrant for his arrest, part of a wider campaign against members of the opposition. He is currently in Spain.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "An 884-page report by Brazil’s police details former President Bolsonaro’s alleged attempt to overturn the 2022 election.\nBrazilian federal police have published a report implicating former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro in an alleged criminal organisation designed to overturn the 2022 presidential election, won by his leftist challenger and current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\nThe 884-page report, made public on Tuesday, outlined eight main pieces of evidence against Bolsonaro, including an alleged meeting he took with members of Brazil’s armed forces to plan the coup.\n“The evidence collected throughout the investigation shows unequivocally that then-President Jair Messias Bolsonaro planned, acted and was directly and effectively aware of the actions of the criminal organisation aiming to launch a coup d’etat and eliminate the democratic rule of law,” the report explained.\nPrior to its release, the report was sent to Brazil’s top prosecutor, Paulo Gonet, who has yet to decide whether to bring charges against Bolsonaro.\nThe report expands on bombshell accusations last week that Bolsonaro and 36 others conspired to retain power, even in the event of an electoral defeat.\nAmong the officials named were former Minister of Defence Walter Braga Netto, ex-National Security Adviser Augusto Heleno, former Minister of Justice and Public Security Anderson Torres and the head of Bolsonaro’s Liberal Party, Valdemar Costa Neto.\nThe police accusations are the latest in a string of investigations and legal woes for Bolsonaro, who led Brazil from 2019 to 2022.\nBolsonaro has denied all claims he tried to stay in office after his narrow electoral defeat in October 2022.\nBut already, his baseless claims about the accuracy of the election have prompted Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) to bar him from holding office again until 2030.\nIn the lead-up to the 2022 election, Bolsonaro made false and unsubstantiated claims on the campaign trail that Brazil’s electronic voting machines could not be trusted, laying the groundwork for a contested election months before the first ballot was cast.\nThe race ended in a run-off, with Lula emerging ahead by just over 2.1 million votes. Experts called it the closest race since Brazil’s return to democracy in th",
    "description2": "e 1980s.\nBut Bolsonaro refused to publicly concede defeat, and his supporters took to the streets in protest. They blocked highways, attacked police headquarters in the capital Brasilia, and even were implicated in a bomb threat against the incoming president.\nTensions boiled over on January 8, 2023, a week after Lula was sworn into office.\nThousands of Bolsonaro supporters descended on the Three Powers Plaza, a square in Brasilia that houses the presidential palace, the Supreme Court and both houses of Congress.\nThey broke into the government buildings, looting and destroying property in the apparent hope of sparking a “military intervention” that would remove Lula from power.\nCritics of Bolsonaro have long questioned his role in the events, though Bolsonaro has staunchly denied participating.\nBut leaked audio recordings suggest high-ranking members of the Brazilian Army were involved in conspiring to keep Bolsonaro in power.\nOn Monday, The Associated Press obtained the audio recordings, which date from the weeks leading up to Lula’s inauguration in late 2022.\nIn the 53 recordings, some military officers can be heard expressing their desire to keep Lula from taking office.\nOne recording features Colonel Roberto Raimundo Criscuoli, a former sub-commander of the army’s special forces. He tells retired Brigadier General Mario Fernandes — who was, at the time, second in command to the general secretary of the presidency — that Bolsonaro had a clear choice about how to respond to the election.\n“It will be either a civil war now or civil war later. We have a justification now for civil war. People are on the streets. We have massive support,” Criscuoli said.\n“Let’s do this now. Speak to 01,” he said, using a code for Brazil’s president.\nSupreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the federal police’s sprawling investigation into Bolsonaro, quoted some of the recordings in a ruling last week ordering the arrest of five people for plotting the assassination of then-President-elect Lula in late 2022.\nLast week, Bolsonaro told the Brazilian news website Metropoles that police accusations were the result of “creativity”, not fact. He added his lawyers were reviewing the matter and would fight the accusations.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Justin Trudeau and Claudia Sheinbaum urge dialogue as Donald Trump plans to hit US neighbours with 25-percent tariffs.\nThe leaders of Mexico and Canada are urging dialogue and cooperation after United States President-elect Donald Trump pledged to impose 25-percent tariffs on the two countries when he takes office early next year.\nDuring a news conference on Tuesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she planned to send a letter to Trump stressing the need to work together on joint challenges.\n“To one tariff will come another and so on until we put our common businesses at risk,” Sheinbaum said, warning that tariffs would cause inflation and job losses in both countries.\nIn a post on social media on Monday evening, Trump said he planned to “charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States”.\n“This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country! Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem.”\nHe also said he planned to impose “an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs” on Beijing, which Washington views as its largest global competitor.\nTrump, who won the November 5 presidential election over his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, had repeatedly said during his 2024 campaign that he would impose increased tariffs on all imports into the US.\nThe former president and his allies have portrayed the tariffs policy as a key tool to bring back jobs and manufacturing from overseas. Experts have said, however, that the move would increase costs for Americans.\nOn Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that he spoke with Trump on Monday evening after the Republican’s online posts. Trudeau said he stressed the longstanding ties between the two countries.\n“We talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together. It was a good call,” he said, adding: “This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on, and that’s what we’ll do.”\nThe Liberal Party leader, whose popularity has dropped significantly over the past few years amid high costs of living and a housing crisis, is under pressure from Conservative politicians at the federal and provincial levels to resolve any problems before Trump takes office.\n“The federal government needs to take the situation at our border seriously,” right-wing Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a social media post on Monday night.\nDanielle Smith, the right-wing premier of Canada’s oil-producing province of Alberta, also said Trump had “valid concerns” about the US-Canada land border, which stretches 6,416km (3,987 miles).\nA 25 per cent tariff would be devastating to workers and jobs in both Canada and the U.S.\nThe federal government needs to take the situation at our border seriously. We need a Team Canada approach and response—and we need it now. Prime Minister Trudeau must call an urgent…\n— Doug Ford (@fordnation) November 26, 2024\n“As t",
    "description2": "he largest exporter of oil and gas to the US, we look forward to working with the new administration to strengthen energy security for both the US and Canada,” she wrote on X.\nTrudeau said on Tuesday that he had spoken with Ford and Quebec Premier Francois Legault and planned to convene a meeting with provincial leaders to discuss the US.\n“There’s work to do, but we know how to do it,” the prime minister added.\nTrump’s threats have already impacted the markets. The Mexican peso initially weakened almost 2 percent against the US Dollar on Tuesday, and shares have dropped in automakers, including Ford and General Motors.\nAsa McKercher, the Hudson research chair in Canada-US relations at St Francis Xavier University in Canada, noted that Trump often threatened to enact harsh policies during his first term in the White House from 2017 to 2021 but didn’t always follow through.\n“My initial thought is that this is probably some sort of negotiating tactic rather than something he actually wants to go through with — in part because it would be hugely damaging to the American economy,” McKercher told Al Jazeera of Trump’s tariffs threat.\nHe explained that the tariffs would drive up prices on many things, including oil and gas supplies from Canada as well as food imports from Mexico.\nThe US and Canada are each other’s largest trading partners, exchanging nearly $2.7bn ($3.6bn Canadian) in goods and services across their shared border daily in 2023, according to Canadian government figures.\nThe Bank of Canada said on Tuesday that if Trump follows through on his threat of tariffs on Canada, it would have an impact on both economies and the central bank would incorporate those into its economic forecasts.\nMeanwhile, US goods and services traded with Mexico totalled an estimated $855bn in 2022, the Office of the US Trade Representative said.\nThe three countries are signatories to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which they signed in 2020 when Trump was president to replace the longstanding North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n“He’s being a bully, which is what he is, and he’s making these kind of threats to see what kind of goodies he can get,” McKercher said of Trump, adding that the Republican’s remarks about fentanyl and irregular migration appear more geared towards Mexico than Canada.\n“That’s not really an issue in Canada-US relations,” he said.\nDuring her news conference, Sheinbaum said her administration had always shown Mexico’s willingness to help fight the fentanyl epidemic in the US and that apprehensions of migrants and asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border were down.\nHowever, Sheinbaum noted that criminal groups in Mexico were still receiving guns from the US. She said the region’s shared challenges require cooperation, dialogue and reciprocal understanding.\n“We do not produce weapons. We do not consume the synthetic drugs,” she said. “Unfortunately, we have the people who are being killed by crime that is responding to the demand in your country.”\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

It said the killings were a result of “the occupation’s aggression”. Israel’s military also confirmed that four Palestinians were killed, describing them as “terrorists”.\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society, meanwhile, reported that Israeli forces had been “preventing our teams from reaching the bombing site”.\nFares Irshaid, a resident of Sir, described the attack to the AFP news agency.\n“In the morning, the planes came and started bombing this area,” Irshaid said. “Shortly after that, the army stormed the entire area. They declared it a closed military zone.”\n“There was a group of young men, including my nephew and the son of our neighbours, and we do not know their fate,” he told the news agency.\nIsrael has not released the bodies of those killed although the military identified one of the dead as 31-year-old Wael Lahluh.\nThere has been a surge in Israeli military operations and violence by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank since the war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023.\nAt least 780 Palestinians have been ki",

The military regularly intervenes to protect Israeli settlers.\nThe latest Israeli operation was carried out after Israel last month launched several raids in Jenin, killing nine people.\nTwo Palestinians, including a teenage boy, were also killed during an Israeli raid in the West Bank village of Yabad on November 24, according to the Palestinian Authority.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Appointment of a loyal aide to the FBI post could end long-running tradition of keeping presidents at arm’s length.\nUnited States President-elect Donald Trump has nominated one of his most loyal aides, Kash Patel, to run the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), drawing a sharp reaction from critics, who question his qualifications and impartiality to hold the position.\nPatel, an outspoken critic of the FBI like his boss, has been entrusted to lead the country’s most important federal law enforcement agency.\nThe 44-year-old has steadfastly promoted the idea of the existence of a “deep state” and the belief the agency is biased against Trump. He has pushed to overhaul the agency.\nWith the nomination of Patel, Trump also signals that he is preparing to carry out his threat to oust Christopher Wray, a Republican he first appointed in 2017 and whose 10-year term does not expire until 2027.\nKashyap Pramod Vinod Patel, commonly known as Kash, was born in the city of New York, a child of immigrant parents originally from the Indian state of Gujarat.\nPatel graduated in law in 2005 from Pace University after earning a certificate in international law from the University College London a year prior. Before that, he finished his bachelor’s degree in criminal justice and history from the University of Richmond.\nAccording to his US Department of Defense biography, Patel is “a life-long ice hockey player, coach, and fan”.\nAs a 40-year-old lawyer with little government experience, Patel joined the administration of then-President Trump in 2019, rising rapidly from the ranks by showing what some media described as his complete devotion to Trump.\n“Each new title set off new alarms,” according to The Atlantic describing Patel. Once, then-CIA Director Gina Haspel had reportedly threatened to resign after Trump said he wanted to appoint Patel as deputy CIA director.\nPatel served in key roles during Trump’s first term, including overseeing the counterterrorism division at the National Security Council and later serving as chief of staff at the Department of Defense.\nBefore his White House roles, Patel worked on the House Intelligence Committee in Congress, where he played a significant role in the investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\nShortly after Trump left office, Patel launched Fight with Kash, an organisation that funds defamation lawsuits and peddles a wide variety of merchandise, including branded socks and other clothing with the “K$H” logo.\nPatel has also authored children’s books that lionise Trump – The Plot Against the King – featuring a thinly veiled Hillary Clinton as the villain going after “King Donald” while Kash plays a wizard who thwarts her plans.\nHe has been a regular guest on right-wing podcasts and livestream online shows hosted by Bannon, Tim Pool, Benny Johnson and others.\nIn a post on Truth Social network, Trump described Patel as a “brilliant lawyer, investigator, and ‘America First’ fighter”.\nTrump has frequently voiced distrust of the FBI, accusing it of political bias, particularly after its search of his Mar-a-Lago\nresort for classified documents he allegedly stored illegally.\nPatel found common cause with Trump over their shared scepticism of government surveillance and the “deep state” – a pejorative catchall used by Trump to refer to government bureaucracy.\nHe wrote another book – Government Gangsters – which is part memoir and part screed against the so-called deep state.\nPatel’s candidacy has won support from prominent Trump supporters, i",
    "description2": "ncluding people who support the president-elect’s agenda at the FBI and Justice Department and the idea of using his electoral win to pursue retaliation against his perceived adversaries.\nTrump said Patel would restore “fidelity, bravery and integrity” to the agency. Under Patel, Trump said, the FBI would “end the growing crime epidemic in America, dismantle the migrant criminal gangs, and stop the evil scourge of human and drug trafficking across the border”.\nPatel was part of a small group of supporters during Trump’s recent criminal trial in New York who accompanied him to the courthouse, where he told reporters that Trump was the victim of an “unconstitutional circus”.\nHe also testified at a Colorado court hearing related to Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the run-up to the January 6, 2021 riot at the US Capitol.\nPatel, who at the time of the riot was chief of staff to the then-acting defence secretary, testified that Trump had pre-emptively authorised 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers to deploy days before the attack. But a Colorado court later found that Patel was “not a credible witness” on the topic.\nAn October 2024 Atlantic article suggested, Patel “appeared singularly focused on pleasing Trump”.\n“Even in an administration full of loyalists, Patel was exceptional in his devotion.”\nFollowing Trump’s announcement on Saturday, Gerry Connolly, a senior Democratic member of the House of Representatives, called Patel a “zealot”.\n“Out of a sea of unqualified, dangerous, and downright bizarre nominations, this is perhaps the worst,” Connolly said in a post on X.\nPatel has signalled through interviews and public statements a determination to upend the FBI and radically reshape its mission.\nHe has called for dramatically reducing its footprint and limiting its authority, as well as going after government officials who disclose information to reporters.\nIn an interview earlier this year on the Shawn Ryan Show podcast, Patel promised to sever the FBI’s intelligence-gathering activities from the rest of its mission, and said he would “shut down” the bureau’s headquarters building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, and “reopen it the next day as a museum of the ‘deep state'”.\nIn a separate interview with conservative strategist Steve Bannon, Patel said he and others “will go out and find the conspirators not just in government but in the media”.\nPatel first came to prominence in Trump’s orbit as an outspoken critic of the FBI’s investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.\nAs a staffer on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired at the time by Representative Devin Nunes, a Trump loyalist, Patel helped author a four-page report that detailed what it said were errors the Justice Department made in obtaining a warrant to surveil a former Trump campaign adviser.\nThe document, which came to be colloquially known as the “Nunes memo”, was released over vigorous objections from Wray and Justice Department leaders.\nA subsequent inspector general report identified significant problems with FBI surveillance during the Russia investigation, but it also concluded that the inquiry had been opened for a legitimate purpose and found no evidence that the FBI had acted with partisan motives in conducting the inquiry.\nA 2020 report by the US Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that the Kremlin launched an aggressive effort to meddle in the 2016 presidential contest on behalf of Trump.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Patel has vowed to downsize the top intelligence body and pursue ‘conspirators’ in the government and media.\nUnited States President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to tap loyalist Kash Patel to head the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a pick that is expected to disrupt the agency and put Trump’s political adversaries in the crosshairs.\nTrump announced the decision in a post on his Truth Social network on Saturday, saying Patel, who wants to downsize the top intelligence body and pursue “conspirators” in the government and media, would restore “fidelity, bravery and integrity” to the agency.\n“Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and ‘America First’ fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People,” Trump wrote.\nThe announcement means current FBI Director Christopher Wray must either resign or be fired after Trump takes office on January 20.\nAlthough Wray is serving a 10-year term, his removal is not surprising given Trump’s longstanding public criticism of him and the FBI. Wray, who replaced Jim Comey, led the FBI as it investigated Trump for alleged obstruction of justice and raided his Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents, leading to indictments.\nThe decision sets up what is likely to be an explosive confirmation battle in the Senate, which must approve the appointment, not long after Trump’s plan to have another trusted ally, Matt Gaetz, lead the Department of Justice fell through.\nPatel is a lesser-known figure, but his nomination is still expected to cause shockwaves. He has embraced Trump’s rhetoric about a “deep state”, called for a “comprehensive housecleaning” of government workers who are disloyal to Trump and has referred to journalists as traitors, promising to try to prosecute some. He has also pledged he would shut do",
    "description2": "wn the FBI’s Washington headquarters and “reopen it the next day as a museum of the ‘deep state’”.\nA son of Indian immigrants, Patel served in several high-level posts during Trump’s first term, including as a national security adviser and as chief of staff to the acting defence secretary.\n“Kash did an incredible job during my First Term,” Trump said, adding that the nominee would work to “end the growing crime epidemic in America, dismantle the migrant criminal gangs, and stop the evil scourge of human and drug trafficking across the Border”.\nDuring the final months of Trump’s first term, he unsuccessfully pushed the idea of installing Patel as the deputy director of either the FBI or CIA. William Barr, Trump’s attorney general, wrote in his memoir that he told then-Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that an appointment to Patel as deputy FBI director would happen “over my dead body”.\n“Patel had virtually no experience that would qualify him to serve at the highest level of the world’s pre-eminent law enforcement agency,” Barr wrote.\nTrump also announced on Saturday that he would nominate Sheriff Chad Chronister, the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County, Florida, to serve as the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). He has worked closely with Trump’s choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi.\n“Chad will work with our great Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to secure the Border, stop the flow of Fentanyl, and other Illegal Drugs, across the Southern Border, and SAVE LIVES,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\nThe FBI is the investigative arm of the Justice Department, while the DEA also falls under its purview.\nThe appointments of Bondi and Patel indicate that Trump is interested in lining up closely aligned appointees willing to carry out his vision and policy inclinations.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",
