    "description1": "The Facebook and Instagram owner says its defences were able to prevent AI-driven misinformation operations from gaining an online foothold.\nDespite fears that artificial intelligence (AI) could influence the outcome of elections around the world, the United States technology giant Meta said it detected little impact across its platforms this year.\nThat was in part due to defensive measures designed to prevent coordinated networks of accounts, or bots, from grabbing attention on Facebook, Instagram and Threads, Meta president of global affairs Nick Clegg told reporters on Tuesday.\n“I don’t think the use of generative AI was a particularly effective tool for them to evade our trip wires,” Clegg said of actors behind coordinated disinformation campaigns.\nIn 2024, Meta says it ran several election operations centres around the world to monitor content issues, including during elections in the US, Bangladesh, Brazil, France, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the European Union.\nMost of the covert influence operations it has disrupted in recent years were carried out by actors from Russia, Iran and China, Clegg said, adding that Meta took down about 20 “covert influence operations” on its platform this year.\nRussia was the number one source of those operations, with 39 networks disrupted in total since 2017, followed by Iran with 31, and China with 11.\nOverall, the volume of AI-generated misinformation was low and Meta was able to quickly label or remove the content, Clegg said.\nThat was despite 2024 being the biggest election year ever, with some 2 billion people estimated to have gone to the polls around the world, he noted.\n“People were understandably concerned about the potential impact that generative AI would have on elections during the course of this year,” Clegg told journalists.\nIn a statement, he said that “any such impact was modest and limited in scope”.\nAI content, such as deepfake videos and audio of political candidates, was quickly exposed and failed to fool public opinion, he added.\nIn the month leading up to Election Day in the US, Meta said it rejected 590,000 requests to generate images of President Joe Biden, then-Republican candidate Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz.\nIn an article in The Conversation, titled The apocalypse that wasn’t, Harvard academics Bruce Schneier and Nathan Sanders wrote: “There was AI-created misinformation and propaganda, even though it was not as catastrophic as feared.”\nHowever, Clegg and others have warned that disinformation has moved to social media and messaging websites not owned by Meta, especially TikTok, where some studies have found evidence of fake AI-generated videos featuring",
    "description2": " politically related misinformation.\nIn a Pew survey of Americans earlier this year, nearly eight times as many respondents expected AI to be used for mostly bad purposes in the 2024 election as those who thought it would be used mostly for good.\nIn October, Biden rolled out new plans to harness AI for national security as the global race to innovate the technology accelerates.\nBiden outlined the strategy in a first-ever AI-focused national security memorandum (NSM) on Thursday, calling for the government to stay at the forefront of “safe, secure and trustworthy” AI development.\nMeta has itself been the source of public complaints on various fronts, caught between accusations of censorship and the failure to prevent online abuses.\nEarlier this year, Human Rights Watch accused Meta of silencing pro-Palestine voices amid increased social media censorship since October 7.\nMeta says its platforms were mostly used for positive purposes in 2024, to steer people to legitimate websites with information about candidates and how to vote.\nWhile it said it allows people on its platforms to ask questions or raise concerns about election processes, “we do not allow claims or speculation about election-related corruption, irregularities, or bias when combined with a signal that content is threatening violence”.\nClegg said the company was still feeling the pushback from its efforts to police its platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in some content being mistakenly removed.\n“We feel we probably overdid it a bit,” he said. “While we’ve been really focusing on reducing prevalence of bad content, I think we also want to redouble our efforts to improve the precision and accuracy with which we act on our rules.”\nSome Republican lawmakers in the US have questioned what they say is censorship of certain viewpoints on social media. President-elect Donald Trump has been especially critical, accusing its platforms of censoring conservative viewpoints.\nIn an August letter to the US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he regretted some content take-downs the company made in response to pressure from the Biden administration.\nIn Clegg’s news briefing, he said Zuckerberg hoped to help shape President-elect Donald Trump’s administration on tech policy, including AI.\nClegg said he was not privy to whether Zuckerberg and Trump discussed the tech platform’s content moderation policies when Zuckerberg was invited to Trump’s Florida resort last week.\n“Mark is very keen to play an active role in the debates that any administration needs to have about maintaining America’s leadership in the technological sphere … and particularly the pivotal role that AI will play in that scenario,” he said.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Decision comes after parliament votes to reject his martial law declaration and cabinet approves reversal of decision made hours earlier.\nSouth Korean parliament votes against president’s martial law declaration | AJ #shorts\nSouth Korea’s president said he would lift a martial law declaration he had imposed just hours before, honouring a parliamentary vote against the measure.\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law on Tuesday to thwart “antistate forces” among his opponents. However, lawmakers rejected the declaration, as protesters gathered outside parliament in the country’s biggest political crisis in decades.\n“In light of the National Assembly’s demand to lift martial law, I ordered the withdrawal of military forces involved in martial law operations,” Yoon said in a televised address. “Through an immediate cabinet meeting, we will accept the National Assembly’s request and proceed to revoke martial law.”\nEarly Wednesday morning, the cabinet agreed to reverse the decision and lift martial law.\nYoon’s surprise declaration, which he cast as aimed at his political foes, was unanimously voted down by 190 lawmakers in the parliament.\nUnder South Korean law, the president must immediately lift martial law if parliament demands it by a majority vote. His own party urged him to lift the decree.\nNevertheless, Yoon called on parliament to immediately “cease repeated acts of impeachment, legislative obstruction, and other reckless actions that paralyse the government”.\nAl Jazeera’s Eunice Kim, reporting from the capital Seoul, said it seemed the country was now “pivoting towards a direction of more normalcy”.\n“But this could be short-lived because the political opponents o",

This is a decision that comes with consequences.”\nSince taking office in 2022, Yoon has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament. Yoon has also been dismissing calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals.\nThe crisis in a country that has been a democracy since the 1980s, and is a US ally and major Asian economy, caused international alarm.\nEntrance to the National Assembly was sealed on Tuesday and parliamentarians were barred from entering the building, according to local news outlet Yonhap.\nGeneral Park An-soo, the martial law commander, announced a number of measures under the declaration, including prohibitions on all political activities, “including those of the National Assembly, local councils, political parties, and political associations, as well as assemblies [and] demonstrations”.\nThe order prohibited labour strikes and slowdowns, as well as “gatherings that incite social disorder”. It further stated that all media will be placed under the control of the Martial Law Command.\n“Any acts that deny or attempt to overthrow the liberal democratic system, as well as the dissemination of fake news, manipulation of public opinion, or false propaganda,” the order said.\nHealthcare workers, including doctors who are currently on strike, must return to work within 48 hours or risk punishment.\n“Violators of this proclamation will be subject to arrest, detention, and search and seizure without a warrant,” the commander noted.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "The China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai attracts 600,000 visitors and billions in sales.\nA squadron of six Chinese Chengdu J-10 jets took off towards an overcast sky in front of thousands of spectators at an airfield in southern China’s coastal city of Zhuhai in mid-November.\nFlying low in a close V-shaped formation, the jets circled back and as they approached a cluster of buildings near the spectators, trails of red, blue, yellow and white smoke suddenly poured from each plane, bringing a cheer from onlookers that was almost as loud as the roar from the warplanes’ engines.\nSeconds later, the J-10s broke their close formation to show off a series of even more impressive acrobatic manoeuvres.\nBut the aerial show by the seasoned pilots was far from the only demonstration of prowess at the China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition, better known as Airshow China or the Zhuhai Airshow, which is held biennially and named after the city in southern China where it is held.\nA wide array of new equipment and aircraft available to the Chinese military – known as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) – was unveiled for the first time at the airshow, held from November 12 to 17. This included an updated version of the Harbin Z-20 helicopter and the long-awaited J-35A stealth fighter while the newest Russian stealth warplane, the Su-57, also took to the skies over Zhuhai in its first appearance outside Russia.\nAccording to Chinese state media, the event attracted nearly 600,000 visitors and resulted in deals worth $38.7bn.\nAside from the business aspect, the airshow serves a clear purpose of showcasing China’s advances in aviation, said Peter Layton, defence and aviation expert at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia. “It is about demonstrating the sophistication and scale of PLA airpower,” he told Al Jazeera.\nBut for a better sense of China’s innovation in airpower, Layton did not look to the acrobatic feats of the J-10s or even the unveiling of the new stealthy J-35A.\n“People like fast jets, loud noise and daring pilots, and the J-35 was the big news announced, but this is actually old news, having been a very long time in development,” he said.\nInstead, Layton looked for advancements in aviation software and drone technology which will define the future of aerial combat.\nFor the next generation of fighter aircraft, military developers and researchers across the world are working on providing pilots with enhanced weapons systems and stealth capabilities that can be comprehensively integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.\nExperts predict the use of AI will especially boost the data processing of a fighter jet, which will greatly improve a pilot’s overview of the battlespace in which they are operating. Whoever is able to carry out the integration of AI and piloting skills most effectively will be in a strong position to dominate the skies.\nThey say essential in this future setup will be one or several drones operating as “loyal wingmen” that can work with fighter pilots in combat by assisting as “a sensor, a shooter, a weapons carrier and cost reducer”.\nThe war in Ukraine has already demonstrated the transformative effects of drones in combat zones. Thousands of them have been used not just as remotely flown bombs but also to track enemy movements and guide artillery strikes.\nBut no military has",
    "description2": " fully developed aircraft with the capability to operate jointly with drones, and the Chinese military most likely will not have a fully developed model in the skies until well into the 2030s, according to Layton.\nThe closest the Chinese military currently is to such an aircraft is the J-20S, which was on display in the form of a scale model at Zhuhai.\nAccording to Chinese state media, the J-20S is a two-seater fighter jet which allows the second pilot to be in charge of collaborating between the jet and a wingman drone that would act as a sensor or a weapon launcher.\nThe FH-97A drone, which can carry out air defence suppression, conduct close-in reconnaissance and engage in interference tasks, is one example of a loyal wingman drone, and it was on display at the airshow in 2022.\nWorking in tandem with a jet and powered by AI, such capabilities could enable a wingman drone to paralyse enemy air systems and allow the fighter pilot to penetrate enemy defences.\nThat and other drone systems will be essential in future aerial combat, Layton said.\nIn Zhuhai, the Chinese military unveiled a new heavy drone, nicknamed the “swarm carrier” because of its ability to not only carry a payload of missiles and bombs but also other smaller drones as well.\nAccording to Layton, Chinese developments in airpower today are closely linked with Beijing’s strategic competition with the United States.\n“And a lot of developments are a mirror image response to American developments,” he said.\nLayton pointed to the Chinese J-35, whose name is similar to the US fighter F-35, both being fifth-generation jets.\nWhile aircraft such as the J-35 and the J-20S might be tied to competition when it comes to the US, for Taiwan they are far more concerning, according to Shu Hsiao-Huang, a research fellow at the Taiwan defence think tank INDSR.\n“China is accelerating the upgrading of its air force and has many creative ideas in the development of drones, which will cause difficulties for neighbouring countries,” Shu told Al Jazeera.\nNot only is Taiwan a neighbour to China, but the Chinese government regards the self-ruled island as an inseparable part of China and has promised to bring the island under its control.\nWhile the majority of countries in the United Nations do not recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state, member states do maintain favourable relations with Taipei, including the US, the United Kingdom and Australia.\nThe US, which switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, remains Taiwan’s most important partner and its largest supplier of weapons, which has resulted in strong condemnation from China.\nShu said Taiwan needs to pay attention to aerial advancements and breakthroughs achieved by the Chinese military, like those displayed at the airshow in November.\n“This Zhuhai airshow was a big warning for Taiwan,” he said.\n“The development of China’s fighter jets, advanced drones and other unmanned systems will pose a great challenge to Taiwan’s air defences,” he said.\nTo be able to keep up with China’s advancements in its air force, Taiwan will need to replace its ageing aircraft, improve ground-based air radar detection capabilities, develop new missile defences, and adopt advanced asymmetric military capabilities, according to Shu.\n“But Taiwan’s progress in this regard is still very slow,” he said, adding, “Which is very worrying.”\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "The attack comes as violence in Syria intensifies, with opposition fighters advancing against government positions.\nWashington, DC – The Pentagon has confirmed that the United States carried out a strike against military assets in eastern Syria after a rocket attack near one of its bases.\nPentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder told reporters on Tuesday that the US military struck weapons systems — including rocket launchers and a tank — that “presented a clear and imminent threat” to its forces in the area.\nThe US strike comes as violence escalates across the war-torn country. Over the last week, armed opposition groups carried out a blistering offensive in northwest Syria against the government forces led by President Bashar al-Assad, ushering in a new stage of the country’s long-running civil war.\nThe offensive has raised questions about how the US might respond and whether it could become entangled in the conflict, given its significant military presence in Syria.\nRyder said on Tuesday that the attack was in response to a rocket launch that fell “in the vicinity” of Military Support Site (MSS) Euphrates, a US base in eastern Syria.\nHe added that it is not clear who was operating the weapons, but Iran-backed groups and Syrian government forces are known to be in the area.\nThe Pentagon spokesperson stressed that the action is “not linked to any broader activities in northwest Syria by other groups”.\nBut on Tuesday, Damascus accused the US of providing air support for the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which pushed to advance against government-controlled villages east of the Euphrates River, near the city of Deir ez-Zor.\nThe SDF has received US support for years under the stated aim of fighting ISIL (ISIS).\nSyrian state-run Alikhbaria TV reported on Tuesday that clashes were taking place between SDF and government forces near the village of Tabiyet Jazira “with the intervention of US occupation jets that are targeting the frontlines in the are",
    "description2": "a”.\nThe SDF had claimed earlier in the day that it took control of seven villages east of the Euphrates due to the “serious threat related to the imminent movement of large ISIS terrorist cells”.\n“The deployment of our forces to these villages is in response to the urgent pleas and appeals of the local populace, following the increasing potential risks that ISIS will exploit the events in the west of the country,” the SDF’s Deir ez-Zor Military Council said in a statement.\nBut the Syrian government said the villages remain under its control.\nFarther west, government troops have been battling rebels trying to advance towards the central city of Hama as the front lines of the war, which had gone mostly dormant over the past four years, see major shifts.\nRebel groups, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which had been confined to the northwestern Idlib province, launched their offensive last week, taking control of Aleppo and heading south towards Hama.\nThe country had experienced relative calm since 2020 with the government, rebel groups and SDF largely remaining within their unofficial territories.\nBut the opposition appears to have struck at an opportune moment when President al-Assad’s main military backers — Russia, Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah — are focusing on their own conflicts elsewhere.\nThe US, which calls Assad a “brutal dictator”, has denied any involvement in the rebels’ offensive, highlighting that Washington considers HTS to be a “terrorist” group.\nHTS is a reiteration of al-Nusra Front, which operated as al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria early in the war.\nAccording to the Pentagon, Washington has 900 troops in Syria and a deep alliance with the SDF, one of the major parties to the conflict.\nOn Tuesday, the Pentagon’s Ryder declined to answer questions about the SDF’s operations in the Deir ez-Zor area.\n“Our focus has been on working with the SDF as it relates to countering ISIS, and that continues to be our focus,” he said.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Israeli officials threaten to expand attacks on Lebanon if the ceasefire with Hezbollah collapses.\nAn Israeli drone strike has killed one person in southern Lebanon, according to Lebanese health authorities, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to enforce the ceasefire with Hezbollah “with an iron fist”.\nLebanon’s Ministry of Public Health and state media said Israeli forces carried out several new drone and artillery strikes in southern Lebanon on Tuesday, putting further strain on a tenuous 6-day-old ceasefire with Hezbollah.\n“An Israeli enemy drone strike on the town of Shebaa killed one person,” a Health Ministry statement said.\nThe state-run National News Agency (NNA) described the man who was killed as a “shepherd”.\nThe new attacks come as Israeli officials threatened to expand attacks on Lebanon if the ceasefire with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah collapses.\nNetanyahu promised to keep striking “with an iron fist” against perceived violations of the truce.\n“We are enforcing this ceasefire with an iron fist,” he said before a cabinet meeting in the northern border city of Nahariya.\n“We are currently in a ceasefire, I note, a ceasefire, not the end of the war,” he added.\nEarlier, his defence minister warned that if the ceasefire collapses, Israel will target not just Hezbollah but the Lebanese state – an expansion of Israel’s campaign.\n“If we return to war we will act strongly, we will go deeper, and the most important thing they need to know: that there will be no longer be an exemption for the state of Lebanon,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said.\n“If until now we separated the state of Lebanon from Hezbollah … it will no longer be [like this],” he said during a visit to the northern border area.\nThe US- and French-brokered ceasefire, which halted more than 13 months of fighting, has been rattled by near-daily Israeli attacks.\nUnder the terms of the ceasefire, Hezbollah is supposed to withdraw its fighters, weapons and infrastructure from a broad swath of the south by the end of the initial 60-day phase, pulling them north of the Litani Ri",
    "description2": "ver. Israeli troops are also to withdraw to their side of the border.\nLebanese officials have accused Israel of violating the ceasefire dozens of times with strikes, overflights of drones and demolitions of homes.\nAt least 11 people were killed in Israeli attacks on Lebanon on Monday, according to official figures.\nHezbollah said it fired a volley of projectiles as a warning over what it said were previous Israeli ceasefire violations.\nReporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said the hostilities on Monday were putting a strain on the truce.\n“The Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire did not collapse despite yesterday’s alleged violations. It faced its biggest test with the flareup in hostilities on both sides,” she said.\n“The deal stands on a shaky ground. Israel is trying to create a new reality. It considers that under the terms of the ceasefire, it has the right to carry out attacks and strikes on what it considers to be threats by Hezbollah,” she added.\nDespite the violations, Lebanese officials are rallying behind the ceasefire. Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati and Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, a close Hezbollah ally who negotiated the deal on behalf of Lebanon, spoke to officials at the White House and French presidency late on Monday to urge them to press Israel to uphold the ceasefire, two senior Lebanese political sources told the Reuters news agency on Tuesday.\nMikati, quoted by NNA, meanwhile, said that diplomatic communications had intensified since Monday to stop Israeli violations of the ceasefire. He also said a recruitment drive was under way by the Lebanese army to strengthen its presence in the south.\nThe US Department of State spokesperson Matt Miller said on Monday that the ceasefire was “holding” and that the US had “anticipated that there might be violations”.\nA mission chaired by the US is tasked with monitoring, verifying and helping enforce the truce, but it has yet to begin work. Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the committee would hold its first meeting on Thursday.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Opposition forces stormed into regime-held areas, shaking the status quo and bringing the war back into the spotlight.\nThe surprise assault on the Syrian city of Aleppo by opposition forces on Wednesday appears to have caught the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and his allies, as well as much of the world, off guard.\nCurrently, as the Syrian and Russian air forces pound opposition forces in northwest Syria, the brutal conflict that many had hoped had frozen since a ceasefire deal in 2020 is showing every sign of reigniting.\nYes.\nSyria’s revolution of 2011 failed to topple the country’s leader, Bashar al-Assad.\nHe leaned on the support of his allies, Russia, Iran and the Lebanese group Hezbollah, who joined his forces in trying to put down the uprising.\nThe fighting drew in both existing regional armed groups, such as ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda – who established linkages to groups in Syria –  and created new factions such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who led last week’s attack on Aleppo.\nMany groups formed to join the war, fighting both the regime forces and, at times, each other as their ideologies clashed.\nHowever, as the conflict wore on, and Russian and Iranian firepower began to tilt the conflict in the regime’s favour, the bulk of those groups were pushed to the northwestern governorate of Idlib especially after they were routed from Aleppo in 2016 after nearly four years of fighting.\nWhile various rebel factions competed for dominance in Idlib, HTS emerged as the dominant faction.\nFormed in 2017 through the merging of various groups, chiefly Jabhat al-Nusra, the group works through the “Syrian Salvation Government” (the opposition’s government) to administer much of Idlib’s governance, including its security, financial and judicial systems.\nJabhat al-Nusra, which had long been associated with al-Qaeda, officially broke ties with the group before HTS’s formation, rebranding itself as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, and then HTS.\nNear-apocalyptic.\nThe UN estimates that, between March 2011 and March 2021, Syria’s war killed 306,887 civilians.\nMore than half of Syria’s pre-war population of 21 million was also displaced by the fighting.\nAspects of the fighting were unsurpassed in their savagery.\nThe regime used chemical weapons and barrel bombs against civilian areas as it fought, along with its allies, to suppress the rebellion against it, not succeeding in fully putting it down.\nIn the power vacuums that formed, armed groups flourished and ISIL gained a foothold, establishing a “caliphate” around the Syrian city of Raqqa in 2014, a presence that inflicted violence on minorities and only came to an end in 2017 after the Western-supported Syrian Democratic Forces drove ISIL out.\nWhile lack of freedoms and economic woes drove resentment of the Syrian government, it was the harsh crackdown on demonstrators that finally pushed protesters to take up arms.\nIn March 2011, inspired by successful uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, pro-dem",
    "description2": "ocracy protests erupted in Syria.\nGlobal warming is said to have played a role in sparking the 2011 uprising.\nSevere drought plagued Syria from 2007-2010, causing as many as 1.5 million people to migrate from the countryside into cities, exacerbating poverty and social unrest.\nIn July 2011, defectors from the military announced the formation of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a group aiming to overthrow the government, marking a slide into armed conflict.\nThey did.\nForeign backing and open intervention played a large role in Syria’s war.\nRussia officially entered the conflict in 2015 and has continued to support al-Assad since. Iran and Iraq, as well as Lebanon-based Hezbollah also supported the regime.\nBacking often separate opposition factions was a diverse array of states, including Turkiye, Saudi Arabia and the US, among others.\nIsrael also carried out air raids inside Syria, reportedly targeting Hezbollah and pro-government fighters and facilities.\nTurkiye, which severed ties with al-Assad in 2011 and shares a long border with Syria’s north, has been the most closely involved.\nMuch of that border hems in the opposition-held areas and Syria’s Kurdish region, where Turkiye has long said members of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) are operating.\nTurkiye supported the FSA and tensions heightened after Syrian regime forces shot down a Turkish fighter jet in 2012 and border skirmishes broke out.\nIn 2016, Turkiye launched Operation Euphrates Shield into Syria, declaring that its aims were to push back ISIL from its borders, as well as the leading Kurdish party, the PYD (Democratic Union Party).\nSeveral countries severed ties with al-Assad as the nature of his war against his people became apparent.\nSyria was expelled from the Arab League in 2011 and many individual nations cut ties, including Canada, Germany, Mexico, Turkiye, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nWhen ISIL’s presence in Syria became known, a Global Coalition against Daesh (an Arabic term for ISIL), comprising some 87 countries, began supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces to expel ISIL from Raqqa.\nHe was.\nAided by an apparent lull in hostilities, as well as the devastating earthquake that ripped through the country and neighbouring Turkiye in February 2023, Syria’s normalisation appeared to be under way.\nBahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates began appointing ambassadors to Syria starting in 2021 while Jordan started to warm towards its neighbour after the devastating earthquakes that hit Syria and Turkiye in February 2023.\nThe Arab League, which suspended Syria in 2011, restored its membership in May 2023. There were even overtures made to start talks between Syria and Turkiye.\nIt is not clear what impact this escalation will have on al-Assad’s international overtures, especially after several countries called him out for refusing to negotiate with the opposition to resolve the long-simmering conflict.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Syrian state media says government troops are in fierce battles with opposition groups in Hama province.\nThe United Nations has expressed alarm over spiraling violence in Syria as opposition groups continue to battle pro-government forces in the central province of Hama, and fighters from a US-backed, Kurdish-led coalition battle government forces in the country’s northeast.\nState news agency SANA said Syrian troops were fighting fierce battles in the central Hama province on Tuesday. Syrian and Russian warplanes carried out air attacks in the northern Hama countryside, according to state media.\nThe opposition groups’ military operations administration said they captured 14 central villages and towns including Halfaya, Taybat al-Imam, Maardis and Suran. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, confirmed that the four towns were taken.\nAfter their rapid takeover of the city of Aleppo last week, the rebel groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), as well as Turkiye-backed opposition fighters, are pressing south towards Hama city, the country’s fourth-largest.\nLast week’s assault by forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is the biggest offensive for years in a conflict which began in 2011 and whose front lines had been frozen since 2020.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “alarmed” by the escalation in violence and called for an immediate halt to the fighting.\nThe UN human rights office warned that the spiralling violence was deepening the suffering endured by millions.\n“Our office has documented a number of extremely concerning incidents resulting in multiple civilian casualties, including a high number of women and children, stemming from attacks by both Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and by pro-government forces,” said a spokesman for UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk.\nThe hostilities are also damaging health facilities, education buildings, and food markets, he added.\nAl Jazeera’s fact-checking agency Sanad mapped sites in Aleppo and Idlib hit by Russian and Syrian warplanes in the operation against the opposition.\nThese sites include medical facilities, camps housi",

It sets a historic precedent for state-sanctioned abductions that saw thousands of children kidnapped from today’s Democratic Republic of the Congo because of their racial makeup.\nAn earlier ruling from a lower court in 2021 rejected the women’s claims.\nHowever, the Appeals court on Monday ordered the Belgian state to “compensate the appellants for the moral damage resulting from the loss of their connection to their mothers and the damage to their identity and their connection to their original environment”.  The five women will receive 250,000 euros ($267,000) combined.\nMonique Bitu Bingi (71), one of the women who brought the case in 2020, told Al Jazeera she was satisfied with the ruling.\n“I am very happy that justice has finally been delivered to us,” she said. ” And I’m happy that this was termed a crime against humanity.”\nHere’s what to know about the case, and why the court ruling is historic:\nThe five plaintiffs, including Bitu Bingi, were among an estimated 5,000 to 20,000 mixed-race children who were snatched from their mothers in the former Belgian Congo (today’s Democratic Republic of the Congo) and forcibly taken to faraway cities, or, in some cases, shipped to Belgium for adoption.\nFollowing the violent rule of King Leopold II, which resulted in the deaths and mutilations of millions of Congolese, the Belgian state took over the occupation and continued to operate an immensely exploitative system over the colony between 1908 and 1960.\nBelgium also controlled the then Ruanda-Urundi, or today’s Rwanda and Burundi, where hundreds, if not thousands of bi-racial children were also taken.\nNow called Metis, a French term meaning ‘mixed’, the children were kidnapped between 1948 and 1961, in the lead-up to Congo’s independence.\nBelgian colonial authorities believed that bi-racial children threatened the white supremacy narrative they had continually pushed and that they used to justify colonialism, experts say.\n“They were feared because their mere existence was shaking the very foundations of this racial theory that was at the core of the colonial project,” Delphine Lauwers, an archivist and historian at the State Archives of Belgium told Al Jazeera.\nAuthorities systematically discriminated against the children and referred to them as “children of sin”. While white Belgian men were not legally allowed to marry African women, such interracial unions existed. Some children were also born to women as a result of rape, in situations where African housekeepers were treated as concubines.\nCatholic missions were key to the abductions. From a young age, bi-racial children were snatched or coerced away from their mothers and sent to orphanages or missionaries, some in Congo or Belgium. The state justified the practice based on a colonial-era law that allowed for the confinement of bi-racial children to state or religious institutions.\nSome of the Belgian fathers refused to acknowledge paternity – because they were from supposedly reputable homes – and so, in many cases, the children were declared to be orphaned or without known fathers.\nColonial authorities also changed the children’s names, first so they would not affect their father’s reputation, and also so the children would not be able to connect with their family members. It was not until 1959, when the three colonies were near attaining independence, that the kidnapping and shipping of children from the region began to abate.\nIn Belgium, some of the children were not accepted because of their mixed backgrounds. Some never received Belgian nationality and became stateless. Metis said they were treated as third-class citizens in Belgium for a long time. Most of those affected can still not access their birth records or find their parents.\nIn March 2018, the Belgian parliament passed a resolution recognising that there had been a policy of targeted segregation and forced abductions of mixed-race children in former Belgian colonies, and that redress was needed.\nLawmakers ordered the Belgian state to investigate what means of repair would be proportional for the African mothers who had had their children stolen from them, and to the bi-racial children who had been ha",
    "description2": "rmed for life as a result.\nA year later, in 2019, the then Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel apologised for the colonial practice, saying Belgium had stripped the children of their identity, stigmatised them, and split up families.\nIn his statement, Michel pledged that “this solemn moment will represent a further step towards awareness and recognition of this part of our national history.”\nHowever, Michel stopped short of naming the crimes of forced abductions. Experts say that was because it would have major repercussions for the state, which would then be forced to possibly pay reparations to thousands of people.\nAlthough rights groups pushed Belgium to take the apology a step further, the government did not budge.\nIn 2020, a group of five female Metis, including Bitu Bingi, sued Belgium on charges of crimes against humanity and demanded 50,000 euros ($52,550) each in compensation.\nIt was historic – the first such case seeking justice for Metis and forcing Belgium to address a set of atrocities linked to its brutal colonial past in Africa. The other plaintiffs are Lea Tavares Mujinga, Simone Vandenbroecke Ngalula, Noelle Verbeken and Marie Jose Loshi.\nThe women, who refer to themselves as sisters, also demanded that the state produce any documents identifying them, such as letters, telegrams, or registers, to trace their origins.\nAll are between 70 and 80 years old. They were forcibly taken to the same mission in the country’s Kasai province when they were babies, far from their separate villages. In the mission, the girls grew close and lived with other bi-racial people.\nThe women said they were treated as outcasts in the mission. They said they did not have enough food and had to gather sweet potato leaves for food.\nWhen Kasai descended into tribal unrest before the Congolese independence announcement in 1960, the missionaries abandoned the girls, along with some 60 other children, and fled to Belgium.\nFighters from the Bakwa Luntu tribe were ordered by the new Congolese state to watch over them. Instead, the men sexually mutilated the girls. Eventually, the women grew up and left, emigrating to France. The trauma, they said, remained.\n“When this kind of love is taken away from children, they’re going to carry that scar for the rest of their lives,” Bitu Bingi told Al Jazeera. “It’s something that cannot be healed like other scars.”\nIn 2021, the case proceedings began. Lawyers representing Belgium argued in hearings in a Brussels civil court that the abductions at the time were legal and that the case should have been brought up a long time ago. Too much time had passed, they claimed.\nLawyer Michele Hirsch, who represents the women, pushed back, saying the trauma was being passed on from one generation to another. “If they are fighting for this crime to be recognised, it is for their children, their grandchildren… We ask you to name the crime and to condemn the Belgian State,” Hirsch appealed to the judges.\nThe court, in December 2021, however, ruled that the Belgian state was not guilty of crimes against humanity and that the policy was to be seen within the context of European colonialism.\nThe women immediately appealed the civil court’s ruling. Subsequent hearings went on between 2022 and 2024.\nIn the appeal hearings, the women again testified to the abuse they had faced. “The Belgian state uprooted us, cut us off from our people. It stole our childhood, our lives, our first names, our surnames, our identities, and our human rights,” Lea Tavares Mujinga, one of the plaintiffs said in court.\nFinally, on Monday, December 2, the Appeals Court delivered its ruling.\nIn its judgement, the court recognised that the Belgian state was responsible for abduction and systematic racial segregation, and ordered that the amount each woman requested be paid.\nIt is the first such ruling of its kind, and experts say it might have implications for other European states which also committed numerous crimes during colonialism, amid loud calls for reparations.\nNicolas Angelet, a second lawyer who represented the women, told Al Jazeera that the ruling could see more affected Metis seek justice in court. A preemptive out-of-court settlement for anyone affected by the discriminatory colonial-era policies could save both the state and potential plaintiffs some time, he said.\nFor now, the legal team is “extremely happy” with Monday’s judgement, Angelet added, but noted that the Belgian side could still appeal to the Supreme Court.\n“It hasn’t ended entirely yet,” he said. “But we feel ready and confident … and we can already enforce this judgement immediately, even if they do go to court.”\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Demonstrations broke out after PM Irakli Kobakhidze postponed EU membership talks until 2028.\nGeorgia pro-EU demonstrations: Thousands of people protest in Tbilisi\nTens of thousands of demonstrators have clashed with riot police in Georgia over the past five nights in protests against the governing Georgian Dream party’s decision to suspend talks aimed at joining the European Union until 2028.\nPrime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, chairman of the populist Dream Party, announced the decision after the European Parliament rejected the results of Georgia’s October 26 parliamentary elections. He accused the European Parliament and “some European leaders” of “blackmail”.\nWhy are people protesting in the country of 3.7 million people in the South Caucasus? And what could happen next?\nProtests erupted on Thursday after Kobakhidze announced that Georgia would suspend talks on accession to the EU for four years.\nThis announcement came just hours after the European Parliament adopted a nonbinding resolution rejecting Georgia’s parliamentary election results due to “significant irregularities”. The resolution called for new elections to be held within a year under international supervision and called for sanctions on Georgian leaders, including Kobakhidze.\nOn Sunday, Kobakhidze told reporters parliamentary elections would not be reheld, further intensifying protests. But it is not just voters who have taken to the streets.\n“This movement now extends beyond public demonstrations,” Tinatin Akhvlediani, a research fellow in the EU Foreign Policy Unit at the Brussels-based think tank Centre for European Policy Studies, told Al Jazeera.\n“Civil servants, including some from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, members of the diplomatic corps and hundreds within the education system have joined the resistance. This signals that Georgians are united in their determination not to abandon their European choice.”\nGeorgia applied to be part of the EU in March 2022 and became a candidate for EU membership in December 2023. The goal of joining the EU has been enshrined in Georgia’s Constitution since 2017.\nAccording to a poll by the Washington-based nongovernmental organisation National Democratic Institute, which is funded by Western governments and US government organisations, almost 80 percent of people in Georgia said they want their country to become an EU member.\nThis is not the first time that public discontent with the Dream party has resulted in protests this year.\nIn May, parliament passed the Dream Party’s “foreign agents bill” with 84 votes among the 150 MPs.\nThe law requires nongovernmental and media organisations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from outside Georgia to register as bodies “pursuing the interests of a foreign power”. This sparked rioting in Tbilisi with critics arguing that the law would curb media freedom and jeopardise Georgia’s bid to join the EU. President Salome Zourabichvili, who is independent and not affiliated with any political party, called the law an “exact duplicate” of a bill passed in Russia in an interview with CNN.\nMany agreed with her. Akhvlediani said: “That legislation, seen as Kremlin-inspired, was widely perceived as an attack on civil society, independent media and free speech. It exemplifies the ruling Georgian Dream party’s pattern of democratic backsliding, state capture, rigging elections and attempts to undermine Georgia’s European aspirations.”\nThe prime minister has been critical, describing the demonstrations as violent and alleging that they are a product of foreign interference.\n“The protests in Tbilisi are not peaceful,” he said during a news conference on Monday.\n“We may be dealing with foreign ‘trainers’ organising these violent groups, but this is a matter of investigation,” he added. He also claimed some of the protesters are foreign nationals.\nHe further claimed that the opposition is trying to create a situation similar to Ukraine’s pro-Europe demonstrations in 2014 in Maidan square. That uprising was followed by Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The largest opposition group in Georgia is the Coalition for Change, which comprises pro-Western liberal parties.\nHowever, at Monday’s news conference, Kobakhidze reaffirmed the government’s commitment to eventually joining the EU.\n“We pledge to make every effort for Georgia’s full membership in the EU by 2030,” he said.\nIn footage of the protests, demonstrators can be seen waving large EU flags while facing off against a squad of riot police. The police have used tear gas and water cannon in attempts to disperse the protesters. Videos also show protesters hitting back at the riot police with fireworks",
    "description2": ".\nProminent opposition leader Zurab Japaridze, a member of the opposition party Girchi (“More Freedom”), was among those arrested.\nThe Georgia chapter of the Germany-based anticorruption watchdog Transparency International issued a news release saying the protesters detained on Monday were physically assaulted by law enforcement officers.\n“Officers were allegedly overheard coordinating to break detainees’ arms or legs, with instructions from their superiors to target the liver and head,” the news release said.\n“Riot police reportedly stripped detainees of their shoes, forcing many to walk barefoot to medical facilities. Mobile phones were confiscated, and detainees were coerced into unlocking them.”\nZourabichvili, the pro-EU president, was elected for a six-year term in 2018. Her presidency is due to end this month. She has reacted to the government’s introduction of the “foreign agents” law and its crackdown on protesters by refusing to step down.\nZourabichvili is the last president to be elected in Georgia by popular vote.\nIn 2017, Georgia approved constitutional changes abolishing the direct election of the president. The next president will be elected for a five-year term by a 300-seat electoral college, which includes the members of parliament and is dominated by the Dream party.\nThe vote for the new president is set to take place on December 14. “On December 29, she will have to leave her residence and surrender this building to a legitimately elected president,” Kobakhidze said on Sunday.\nGeorgian Dream has picked far-right former football international Mikheil Kavelashvili as its candidate for the largely ceremonial post.\nBut the current president has refused to step down over doubts about the legitimacy of the October elections. “There is no legitimate parliament. Therefore, an illegitimate parliament cannot elect a new president,” she said in a video on Saturday.\nThe EU released a statement on Sunday saying the union “regrets Kobakhidze’s statement on Georgian Dream’s decision not to pursue the opening of EU accession negotiations and rejecting EU financial support until 2028”.\nIt added that the decision marks a shift from previous Georgian governments’ enthusiasm for joining the EU. The EU statement read: “The Georgian authorities’ course of actions and democratic backsliding led to the de facto halt of the accession process already in June this year.”\nAfter condemning police violence against pro-Europe protesters, the statement concluded: “The EU stands with the Georgian people and their choice for a European future. The door to the EU remains open and the return of Georgia to the European values and the EU accession path is in the hands of the Georgian leadership.”\nThe US Department of State also released a statement on Saturday saying: “By suspending Georgia’s EU accession process, Georgian Dream has rejected the opportunity for closer ties with Europe and made Georgia more vulnerable to the Kremlin.”\nThe statement added: “We reiterate our call to the Georgian government to return to its Euro-Atlantic path, transparently investigate all parliamentary election irregularities, and repeal anti-democratic laws that limit freedoms of assembly and expression.” This referred to laws including the foreign agents bill and an anti-LGBTQ bill that was passed in September.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that Russia was not interfering in Georgian politics. “Everything that is happening in Georgia is its internal business,” he said.\nPeskov, however, drew parallels between the current protests in Georgia and the Maidan protests in Ukraine.\nHe said Georgia is “moving rapidly along the Ukrainian path into the dark abyss”, adding that this would end “very badly”.\n“The future is uncertain, but the protests clearly underscore mounting public dissatisfaction with the government’s blunt deviation from Georgia’s European course,” Akhvlediani said.\nShe added that the government’s crackdown on protests risks “further fuelling resistance and expanding the scale of demonstrations” and the international community’s response to the crackdown on the protests will be “critical”.\n“Targeted sanctions against individuals responsible for election rigging and democratic backsliding, as seen in actions taken by the Baltic states, should be considered,” she said. “Such measures would demonstrate solidarity with the Georgian people and pressure the government to respect the will of its citizens.\n“The EU, the US and the other Western allies of the country should also continue supporting civil society and free media, which represent the backbone of Georgian democracy.”\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

Several Western countries have also questioned the results.\nHowever, Georgia’s top court on Tuesday threw out an attempt by Zurabishvili and opposition groups to overturn them.\n“The Constitutional Court of Georgia did not accept the lawsuits of the president and political parties regarding the recognition of the October 26 elections as unconstitutional,” it said in a statement.\nKobakhidze has insisted he will not hold talks with the opposition and, in comments that resemble Russian narratives, has accused it of trying to stage a Ukraine-style pro-EU uprising funded from abroad.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Washington suggested teenagers join the war as Ukraine demanded more aid, signalling a rift between allies.\nKyiv, Ukraine – Vladislav thinks lowering the conscription age in Ukraine from 25 to 18 is a “bad idea”.\nHis military service is a sad yet telling example.\nThe fair-haired, gaunt 20-year-old volunteered to join the Ukrainian army two years ago – and suffered a heavy contusion near the eastern city of Kupiansk.\n“It was scary, scary, scary,” Vladislav told Al Jazeera in central Kyiv, as he dragged on a cigarette.\n“I’ve seen a lot. I’ve got problems with my head,” he said as if apologising for his reluctance to talk about his combat experience.\nVladislav is awaiting a medical assessment that would either have him demobilised – or dispatched back to the frontline in the southeastern Donbas region, where the outmanned and outgunned Ukrainian forces slowly lose ground to Russian invaders.\nWhile he was able to choose to volunteer legally at 18, he does not believe in compulsory enlistment for 18-year-olds.\nA senior White House official urged Kyiv on Thursday to lower conscription age to 18 to replenish the losses of manpower in Donbas, where Russian forces have spurred their advance on several strategic, heavily fortified strongholds.\n“The need right now is manpower,” the unnamed official told reporters in Washington. “Mobilisation and more manpower could make a significant difference at this time, as we look at the battlefield today.”\nUkraine’s top brass has not even discussed the issue.\n“No meetings to discuss this issue have been held, no suggestions on lowering [the conscription age] have been made,” a source in Ukraine’s General Staff of Armed Forces told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.\nSo far, Kyiv has officially responded with a refusal and a rebuke.\n“It doesn’t make sense to see calls for Ukraine to lower the mobilisation age, presumably in order to draft more people, when we can see that previously announced [Western military] equipment is not arriving on time,” Dmitry Litvin, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, posted on X.\n“Because of these delays, Ukraine lacks weapons to equip already mobilised soldiers,” he wrote.\nSome Ukrainians echo Litvin’s opinion.\n“How about they give us more arms without any delays?” Oleksiy Surovchenko, a 64-year-old ex-police officer told Al Jazeera, referring to President Joe Biden’s outgoing administration.\n“America got us into this mess, and now we’re paying for their indecisiveness and inaction,” he added angrily, referring to Washington’s efforts to destroy the colossal stockpiles of Soviet-era weaponry in Ukraine in the 1990s and early 2000s.\nAfter Barack Obama was elected US senator representing Illinois, his first foreign trip was to Donbas in 2005, where he oversaw the destruction of artillery shells.\nObama helped secure a further $48m from the US Congress to fund the destruction of 400,000 small arms, 1,000 portable anti-aircraft missiles and 15,000 tonnes of ammunition.\nThe ca",
    "description2": "sh-strapped Ukrainian governments largely ignored the needs of their armed forces and transferred many key weapons such as strategic bombers to Russia as payment for natural gas supplies.\nUntil 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea and backed separatists in Donbas, Russia was not seen as a potential aggressor, and its president, Vladimir Putin, enjoyed an average approval rating of 59 percent among Ukrainians.\nA decade later – and almost three years after Moscow’s full-scale invasion – some Ukrainians still see Russians as a friendly, brotherly Slavic nation they do not want to fight.\n“I would choose to be shot to death right here, in Kyiv instead of going to the frontline,” Serhiy, a 17-year-old high school graduate, told Al Jazeera. “I wouldn’t be able to raise my hand at the people of my blood.”\nHe cited the customs of Cossacks, a medieval caste of frontier warriors in what is now central Ukraine who formed quasi-democratic communities and combined nomadic cavalry tactics with firearms.\n“Our forefathers, Cossacks, didn’t allow a man who had no children, no heirs, to go to war,” Serhiy said. “I would have done the same. If there are no people, who the hell needs this land?”\nUkraine’s population stood at 50 million before the 1991 Soviet collapse, but the birthrate among Ukrainian women was already one of Europe’s lowest.\nThese days, more than 6 million Ukrainians live in annexed Crimea and large chunks of four Russia-occupied regions, and millions more have fled to Europe and elsewhere.\nKyiv controls 81 percent of pre-war Ukraine’s territory, where fewer than 30 million people live.\nSerhiy’s mother, Neela, also objects to a lower conscription age – because younger people “aren’t developed mentally, they will jump on [enemy] weapons without thinking, without understanding”.\n“They don’t yet have a feeling of self-preservation, they are just flying into battle,” she told Al Jazeera. “This will be destruction of the Ukrainian people.”\nA military expert compared the White House’s idea to blackmail.\n“You come up with unacceptable conditions for the side you interact with. If you don’t lower fighting age, we will discuss the supply of certain arms. This is some sort of justification” not to provide further military aid, Ivan Tymochko, head of the Council of Reservists of the Ground Forces told the Ukrainske Radio.\nIn April, President Zelenskyy signed in a law that lowered fighting age from 27 to 25 – after 10 months of deliberation.\nSince then, conscription patrols have been frantically rounding up men of fighting age throughout Ukraine amid accusations of abuse, the use of force and corruption.\nWashington’s call was followed by an announcement from Moscow.\nOn Monday, Russian Colonel General Ivan Buvaltsev said Russia has trained 300,000 reservists to be dispatched to the Ukrainian fronts.\nHe claimed the reservists were trained as stormtroopers in conditions that “resemble” Ukraine’s terrain and mimic Kyiv’s defence installations.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Raising tariffs on US goods may hurt the economy, but can Trump push them through anyway?\nUS President-elect Donald Trump – who during the campaign called tariff “the most beautiful word in the dictionary” – wasted little time after his election win before proposing even more stringent tariffs on US trading partners.\nTrump’s campaign promises included adding a 10 percent to 20 percent tariff on all non-domestic goods sold in the United States, a 60 percent tariff on goods from China and reciprocal tariffs on nations that impose tariffs on the US. Then, on November 25, Trump promised new 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10 percent tariff on China.\nEconomists say that Trump following through on these promises could reactivate inflation, a key issue Trump rode to victory in the 2024 election.\nOur review of academic studies of real-world tariffs concluded that consumers ultimately shoulder most of the burden in higher prices for goods, and the burden outweighs tariffs’ economic benefits. There is near consensus among economists on this question, surveys show.\nIndependent groups have estimated that Trump’s proposed tariffs would cost a typical family from $2,000 to $4,000 annually, estimates that were calculated before the most recent tariff proposals.\nIf fully applied, the new North American tariffs could raise grocery prices, given that Mexico accounted for 69 percent of US vegetable imports and 51 percent of fresh fruit imports in 2022. New tariffs on Canada could also spike gasoline prices, especially in the upper Midwest, which relies on Canadian crude oil imports. Construction prices could rise, too; one-quarter of the lumber used in the US comes from Canada, and both Canada and Mexico supply cement, metals, machinery and other home-building necessities.\nSupply chains for these and other goods could not quickly switch to domestic sources, which would force consumers to pay more or skip buying what they don’t absolutely need.\nIf Trump wants to follow through on the tariffs, there may be no way to stop him. Experts say he could act unilaterally, without support from a Congress that’s perhaps more ambivalent about tariffs than he is. Agricultural states, which hold significant sway in the Senate, worry about retaliatory tariffs by US trading partners that could blow up longstanding export markets.\n“There appear to be few practical or legal barriers to Trump making good on his campaign promise,” concluded trade specialists Warren Maruyama, Lyric Galvin and William A Reinsch with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank focusing on national security.\nA tariff is, in effect, a tax on imported goods. More than a century ago, tariffs accounted for most of the federal government’s revenue, but in recent decades, domestic taxes have become the primary federal income source. After 70 years of international negotiations to promote free trade, tariffs have recently hovered at about 2 percent of total federal revenue, according to the Congressional Research Service.\nAfter Trump was elected in 2016, he unilaterally ordered tariff increases, totalling an estimated $80bn, on items such as steel, aluminium, washing machines, solar panels and a variety of goods from China. As a result, foreign tariffs collected by the federal government doubled between 2015 and 2020, to $74bn. When Joe Biden defeated Trump in 2020’s presidential election, Biden retained many of Trump’s tariffs.\nIt remains to be seen whether Trump intends to follow through or whether raising the spectre of tariffs is a tactic to win concessions from those countries.\nAccording to Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress holds the power to impose tariffs, not the president.\nHowever, over the years, Congress has passed multiple laws ceding some of that power to the president.\n“Legally, there is no distinction between Congress imposing tariffs and a president who imposes tariffs operating within law,” said Ross E Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist specialising in trade.\nTariff-applicable powers available to Trump include:\nSection 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, which lets the president impose tariffs if national security is threatened. Trump has already used this authority for his steel and aluminium tariffs, some of which Biden retained.\n“While some argue that it would be a stretch for Trump to claim that all imports are a threat to US national security under Section 232, the courts have routinely deferred to presidents on foreign affairs and trade policy, and legal challenges to the Section 232 tariffs haven’t gone anywhere,” Maruyama, Galvin and Reinsch wrote for the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nSection 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which allows tariffs when the president determines that a foreign country “is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commer",
    "description2": "ce” through violations of trade agreements. Trump used this authority for some of his first-term tariffs on China and on civil aircraft from the European Union; Biden used it for tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and other technology products.\nSection 301 requires a determination by the Office of the US Trade Representative; Section 232 requires an investigation by the Commerce Department. But “these procedural niceties could be accomplished in relatively short order by cabinet officials,” Maruyama, Galvin and Reinsch wrote.\nTariffs on China would be “easiest to impose” using Section 301 authority, said Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist.\nBurkhart said: “Congress is unlikely to raise a great deal of objection to tariffs on China. The public tends to view China’s trade policies with the US as being unfair, which makes this an easier tariff to implement.”\nSection 338 of the 1930 Tariff Act, which hasn’t been used for decades but which could allow the president to place up to a 50 percent tariff on foreign goods if the US International Trade Commission finds that the foreign country has used unfair trade practices against the US.\nSection 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, which allows the president to add a 15 percent tariff on imports for 150 days given “large and serious” deficits in the US balance of payments with other nations or to prevent “an imminent and significant depreciation of the dollar” in foreign exchange markets.\nSection 203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows tariffs on all imports during war or an emergency. Declaring such an emergency would require only an executive order from Trump. Trump threatened to use this authority in 2019 against Mexico, citing illegal immigration into the US, but later that year, the two countries came to an agreement on immigration policy that headed off its use.\nAlan Wm Wolff, a Peterson Institute for International Economics senior researcher, has written that an overly broad application of Section 203 – to “allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas – would be “too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute”.\nBut Maruyama, Galvin and Reinsch argued that the law’s language is broad enough to fit Trump’s needs. “It is not a stretch” to imagine Trump expanding the law to address large US trade deficits, they wrote.\nThese five provisions allow Trump substantial leeway on trade policy – and there’s no surefire way to stop him, experts said.\nTariff opponents could sue, but legal challenges would face “a steep uphill climb”, Maruyama, Galvin and Reinsch wrote. “The courts, including the Supreme Court, traditionally have been reluctant to interfere with the president’s exercise of foreign affairs and tariff powers.”\nThe US Court of International Trade rejected some of Trump’s unilateral tariff proposals in his first presidency, but it’s unclear how that court would rule on these new proposals, Kent Jones, a Babson College emeritus economics professor, said.\nUS trading partners could challenge Trump’s policies at the World Trade Organization, the international arbiter for trade, but this hasn’t swayed him. “President Trump has often stated that he does not consider WTO rules or any other trade agreements to be binding on the US, and this consideration would be unlikely to constrain his decision to impose unilateral tariffs,” Jones said.\nCongress could pass legislation to limit Trump’s tariffs or use the threat of doing so as leverage. If the tariffs are as broad and deep as Trump has recommended, deep-pocketed businesses might press lawmakers to oppose them.\n“The sheer magnitude of a global tariff will make businesses squeamish,” Burkhart said. “These are large lobbying constituencies on Capitol Hill, and they will surely make a lot of noise when a global tariff is proclaimed by President Trump, no matter the legal circumstances under which such a tariff is justified.”\nHowever, both the Senate and the House have Republican majorities. And Trump could strategically exempt certain companies to divide and weaken his opposition.\n“By playing favourites on tariff exemptions, the government can distribute rewards to friendly or compliant companies,” Jones said.\nThe most likely, and potentially most effective, response would be for foreign countries to raise their own tariffs on US goods, ratcheting up the economic pain for the US.\nWidespread economic damage, particularly from inflated prices, could lead to an electoral reversal of fortune for Trump and might be the only lever that works in the end, experts said.\n“The biggest pushback against unilateral, across-the-board tariffs would likely come from US consumers and US retailers and distributors that purchase the imports, since their prices are likely to jump significantly, probably by close to the full amount of the tariffs,” Jones said.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Kyiv reiterates call for formal invitation as security alliance diplomats meet to discuss war.\nUkraine has slammed a 30-year-old security agreement as it reiterated its call for NATO membership.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kyiv on Tuesday slammed 1994’s Budapest Memorandum, which saw the newly independent country give up the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal for security guarantees from Russia and the West.\nThe criticism of the “short-sighted” deal came before a NATO meeting that is expected to discuss the growing possibility of negotiations to end the war with Russia.\n“We are convinced that the only real guarantee of security for Ukraine, as well as a deterrent to further Russian aggression against Ukraine and other states, is Ukraine’s full membership in NATO,” the Foreign Ministry statement read.\nThe Budapest Agreement – signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan – was “a monument to short-sightedness in strategic security decision-making”, it continued.\n“Not providing Ukraine with real, effective security guarantees in the 1990s was a strategic mistake that Moscow exploited. This mistake must be corrected.”\nThe message, marking this week’s 30th anniversary of the pact, came as NATO foreign ministers convened in Brussels to discuss the grinding Ukraine war, in which Russia has made recent battlefield gains.\nWith the upcoming return of Donald Trump to the White House raising uncertainty over US support, Kyiv fears being forced to the negotiating table.\nAs well as the “failed” Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine’s government has condemned the Minsk agreements, which implemented an uneasy ceasefire following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and subsequent fighting with pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country.\n“Enough of the Budapest Memorandum. Enough of the Minsk agreements. Twice is enough, we cannot fall into the same trap a third time,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.\nAmid this fear of a forced ceasefire that would leave Ukrainian territory under Russian control and the rest of the country threatened by aggression in the future, Kyiv is urging NATO with increasing urgency for an invitation for it to formally join the security alliance.\n“With the bitter experience of the Budapest Memorandum behind us, we will not accept any alternatives, surrogates or substitutes for Ukraine’s full membership in NATO,” said the Foreign Ministry.\n“Inviting Ukraine to join NATO now will become an effective counter to Russian blackmail and will deprive the Kremlin of its illusions about the possibility of hi",
    "description2": "ndering Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic integration,” it added.\n“It is also the only chance to stop the erosion of key principles of nuclear non-proliferation and restore confidence in nuclear disarmament.”\nHowever, NATO has given little indication it will formally welcome Ukraine into the fold soon. Speaking on the sidelines of the NATO meeting on Tuesday, the bloc’s chief Mark Rutte did not address NATO accession, but urged the alliance to “do more” to put Ukraine in a favourable negotiating spot.\n“We will all need to do more. The stronger our military support to Ukraine is now, the stronger their hand will be at the negotiating table,” Rutte said, adding that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin thinks he can “break Ukraine’s resolve and ours, but he is wrong”.\nKyiv’s calls for robust security guarantees have grown more urgent since the election of Trump, who has pledged to end the war quickly, suggesting Ukraine may have to make tough concessions or risk losing US arms support.\n“We’re getting ready for the worst-case scenario, when [Trump] stops all the supplies,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, the former deputy head of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, recently told Al Jazeera.\nBracing for a Trump presidency, Zelenskyy has said the country is ready to negotiate but must do so with strong leverage, such as with NATO membership and other security assurances.\n“There will be no capitulation from the side of Ukraine,” said Zelenskyy at a Sunday news conference, acknowledging “we do have to find diplomatic solutions”.\nThe war in Ukraine, dragging through its third year, has killed or injured hundreds of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers, creating manpower woes for both sides.\nRussia, which has brought in thousands of fighters from North Korea to boost its war effort, views Ukraine’s integration into NATO as anathema and says it is an unacceptable security threat.\nUkraine said on Tuesday that it had repelled a bid by Russian forces to cross the Oskil River, which has long been a de facto front line in the east.\n“As a result of the successful operation, the enemy was destroyed. The right bank of the Oskil river is under the control of the Defence Forces,” the Ukrainian military said in a statement.\nKyiv also reported that it had shot down 22 of 28 drones that Russia fired overnight at critical infrastructure in the western Ternopil and Rivne regions.\nAs it has each winter since its February 2022 invasion, Russia has been targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, triggering power cuts across the country as temperatures drop.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

He specifically points to their efforts to impeach prosecutors.\nIn a nationally televised speech, President Yoon denounced the opposition for using its majority in the National Assembly to impeach members of his cabinet and block the passage of his government's budget plans, New York Times reported.\nHe said this has \"paralysed the administration.\"\nYoon further said, \"The National Assembly, which should have been the foundation of free democracy, has become a monster that destroys it,\" the New York Times reported.\nFollowing this, The opposition calls for Yoon's immediate resignation - and vows to begin impeachment proceedings if he doesn't step down. Yoon also faces criticism within his own ranks, with his party chief apologizing to the public and asking the president for an explanation. (ANI)\n\n\n",

Rahul Gandhi fully knows that he will not be allowed to enter Sambhal yet he is enacting this cheap drama. He is indulging in a dangerous game and pedalling a deadly communal and divisive agenda purely for the reasons of his politics of religious appeasement,\" Kesavan said in a self-made video.\n\n\nHe further said that the Sambhal district administration had issued probatory orders barring outsiders from visiting the district.\n\"",
    "description2": "The Sambhal district administration has issued probatory orders barring outsiders from visiting but Rahul Gandhi, why is he indulging in theatrics fully knowing that his actions will incite and stoke communal tension in the area? Rahul Gandhi nor the Congress Party is bothered about social harmony and maintaining peace. All their work, all their concern is about their communal agenda and more communal tension will suit their politics of hate,\" he added.\nEarlier today, Congress leader Ajay Kumar Lallu said that Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi will surely visit the violence-hit Sambhal and meet the families of the victims, and will raise their voices in the Parliament.\n\"Why is the Government stopping us? What are they trying to hide, what are they scared of? Being the Leader of the Opposition, he has the right to see what is going on in the country. The incident that took place in Sambhal is highly condemnable. People have been killed. Who is responsible? If the LoP does not visit the site, how will he keep the issue in the Parliament? We want to see the situation in Sambhal but why is the Government stopping us? Isn't this a dictatorship? Rahul Gandhi will surely visit Sambhal and meet the families of the victims,\" Lallu told ANI.\nThe violence in Sambhal district erupted on November 24 during an Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) examination of a Mughal-era mosque. The clashes resulted in four fatalities and multiple injuries among police personnel and locals.\nThe ASI survey followed a petition filed in a local court, claiming the mosque's site was originally a Harihar temple.

    "description1": "\n\n\nNew Delhi [India], December 4 (ANI): Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Sanjay Singh on Wednesday gave zero hour notice in the parliament on the issue of Bus Marshals and appointment of Civil Defence Volunteers.\nThe issue of appointing Civil Defence Volunteers (CDVs) as marshals aboard public-run buses in Delhi triggered a row between the AAP government and the BJP.\n\nIn October, the bus marshals held a protest to get reinstated after Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena terminated their services in October last year.\nThese bus marshals were appointed to ensure the safety of the women in the buses plying in the national capital.\nEarlier on December 3, AAP MP Raghav Chadha had filed a suspension of Business notice in the Rajya Sabha under Rule 267 seeking to discuss the 'deteriorating law and order' situation and the 'rise in crimes' in the national capital.\nAAP Rajya MP Sanjay Singh has also filed an adjournment motion notice in the upper house seeking to discuss the deteriorating law and order situation concerning the 'increasing crimes' in Delhi.\nSingh had also filed a Suspension of Business Notice earlier on December 2 and also on November 29 seeking to discuss the increasing crime rate in the national capital.\n\n\nIn the notice Singh filed, he mentioned that \"statistics from prominent newspapers,\" highlight an increase in crimes like robbery, attempted murders, and crimes against women and elderly have ",
    "description2": "increased.\"\n\"Statistics from leading newspapers of 2024 highlight the worrying situation of crime in the capital. Robbery cases have increased by 23 pc, theft cases by 25.2 pc while attempted murders have increased by 18pc,\" Singh said in the notice.\nAdding on, the notice said, \"Delhi tops the list of crimes against women among metros. This clearly shows the flaws in the functioning of law and order.\"\nAAP MPs on November 29 staged a protest in the premises of the Parliament, alleging a deteriorating law and order situation in the national capital.\nThe protest was held by AAP leaders Sanjay Singh, Raghav Chadha, Sandeep Pathak and other party leaders.\n\"Zero hour\" begins right after the end of the \"question hour\" in the parliament. Zero hours precisely start at 12 noon that's why it is named \"zero hour\". During this period in the parliamentary operations, the members of parliament can put up issues that are of public interest.\nMatters of substantial interest can be put up in the parliament in zero hour without any advance notice. The duration of \"zero hour\" has evolved over the years.\nSince no mention of zero hour has been described in the constitution or parliamentary rule book it is impossible to speculate on the issues put up in the \"zero hour\". It is important to note that the concept of \"zero hour\" is not stated anywhere in the constitution or rules of the parliament but it still exists. (ANI)\n",

We did not see much action because our fleet had completely blockaded East Pakistan and there was no escape...So, both in the west and east, the Navy played its spectacular role and it's a proud moment for all Men in White to commemorate that success during the 1971 war...\"\nEarlier today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his greetings on the occasion of Indian Navy Day and saluted the valiant personnel of the Indian Navy for their unmatched courage and dedication.\n\"On Navy Day, we salute the valiant personnel of the Indian Navy who protect our seas with unmatched courage and dedication.

    "description1": "\n\n\nNew Delhi [India], December 4 (ANI): Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi on Wednesday moved an adjournment motion notice in the Lok Sabha urging for a discussion on the Adani matter.\nThe motion notice filed by Congress MP Gogoi calls for an urgent discussion on the 'silence' of the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) in the face of serious allegations against the Adani Group, which has been charged with bribery and securities fraud by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nIn a notice to the Lok Sabha Secretary General, Gogoi said, \"I hereby give notice of my intention to move a motion for the adjournment of the business of the house for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent importance. SECI, a central player in India's renewable energy sector, has inexplicably maintained a stoic silence even as the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have leveled damning charges of bribery and securities fraud against the Adani Group.\"\nIn the notice, Gogoi highlighted that the lack of any statement or action from SECI undermines essential principles of transparency and accountability that are expected of public sector entities.\n\"These allegations directly implicate solar power deals facilitated by SECI itself. The lack of any statement or action from SECI undermines the principles of transparency and accountability that should govern public sector undertakings,\" read the notice.\n\"Moreover, the Adani Group's alleged involvement in corrupt practices casts a shadow over the renewable energy sector, vital for Indin's energy security and climate goals. SECTs silence oaly deepens this concern. Further, the SECI's role in awarding contracts to Adani Group companies raises questions about the due diligence processes followed and the safeguards to protect public funds,\" read the notice.\nIt further said, \"The silence of SECI cannot be allowed to continue. I urge the House to support this adjournment motion and demand a thorough investigation into SECTs role in the Adani affair. Public institutions cannot be compromised to safeguard the business interests of a select few.\"\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Lok Sabha Secretariat requested members of the House to not hold",
    "description2": " protests or demonstrations in front of the gates of Parliament as it causes serious hindrances to the movement of Members to the Parliament Chambers during the sittings of the Houses.\n\n\nThis came after Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi, Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, AAP MP Sanjay Singh and other leaders of INDIA bloc on Tuesday staged protest in the premises of the Parliament over the issue of the Adani indictment.\nProtesting leaders held banners and raised several slogans, demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into Adani indictment.\nYesterday Parliament witnessed dramatic events as INDIA bloc leaders staged a protest in the Parliament premises demanding a discussion on the Adani indictment.\nCongress-led opposition MPs walked out of the lower house of the Parliament to mark dissatisfaction over Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan's reply on the Minimum Support Price (MSP) issue.\nIn a post on Facebook, Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi shared pictures of the protest saying, \"Protesting at Makar Dwar, Parliament complex, today, asking the real question: Who will benefit from the billions of Adani, Modi ji? The Prime Minister's silence speaks volumes.\"\nCongress MP Shashi Tharoor said that this protest by INDIA bloc leaders marks the end of the protest that the opposition held in the last 6 days in Parliament. He added that from now onwards the opposition will cooperate in the proceedings of the Parliament.\n\"It's a whole set of issues to do with the Modi government's policies. To be very honest, it is a sort of clear signal to the ruling party that many of their policies have found very strong opposition throughout the country. While we are going to cooperate in the House from this morning, nonetheless there was one, sort of salvo to be fired as a form of protest before going out to debate and participate in the Parliamentary processes. Essentially, we are marking the end of the protest for the last 6 days in Parliament,\" Tharoor said.\nParliament proceedings have been stalled since the beginning of the Winter Session amid protests by opposition parties over the Adani issue and violence in Manipur and Sambhal.\nThe winter session of Parliament began on November 25 and will continue till December 20.

    "description1": "American billionaire Bill Ackman has raised concerns about the Biden administration's efforts to secure long-term union agreements with federal workers ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. In a post on X, Ackman claimed that President Joe Biden is attempting to “make permanent the Deep State” before leaving office. He argued that these efforts were designed to burden the government with unsustainable contracts, making it harder for Trump and the department of government efficiency (DOGE) to succeed. “This needs to stop now,” Ackman concluded.&mdash; BillAckman (@BillAckman) Ackman’s remarks come as the Biden administration pushes forward with a deal that could affect tens of thousands of social security administration (SSA) employees. Last week, the American federation of government employees (AFGE) secured an agreement with the SSA, ensuring hybrid work protections for staff until 2029 with employees working from home as well. The union represents 42,000 SSA workers, and this contract promises to maintain staffing levels while protecting telework arrangements, a key issue for many employees.“This deal will secure not just telework for SSA employees, but will secure staffing levels through prevention of higher attrit",
    "description2": "ion, which in turn will secure the ability of the Agency to serve the public,” AFGE President Everett Couture wrote in a message to union members. A spokesperson for the SSA confirmed the update to the telework policy but noted that managers could still make temporary changes based on operational needs.Unions, including AFGE, are pushing to extend existing collective bargaining agreements with federal workers before Trump takes office. Some union leaders are even calling for an executive order from the White House to formalise these changes.As Biden’s administration seeks to finalise these agreements, Trump’s transition team, led by billionaire Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, is preparing to implement sweeping changes. Musk and Ramaswamy plan to reduce government spending and streamline federal operations, focusing on cutting the workforce and eliminating work-from-home policies. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, the duo argued that requiring federal employees to return to the office full-time would “result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome.”&mdash; elonmusk (@elonmusk) DOGE aims to make significant cuts by focusing on reducing the federal budget by $2 trillion, with the department set to dissolve by 2026.",

    "description1": "Rome: It has probably been centuries since Romans have been so feverish about happenings at the Colosseum, and it is not because of the recent release of the Ridley Scott \"Gladiator\" sequel. A plan by the Colosseum and Airbnb to give a select few people the chance to unleash their \"inner gladiator\" at the most visited site in Italy has caused an uproar among many Romans who say its demeans a treasured cultural icon.Over two nights in May, a total of up to 32 people will learn the art of gladiator fighting at the ancient arena, taught by Roman history buffs who specialise in historical re-enactments. The project is a partnership between the Colosseum Archaeological Park and Airbnb, the accommodations booking platform, which donated $1.5 million to spruce up a permanent exhibit inside the arena. The aim, Airbnb said, \"was to support the Colosseum's ongoing conservation work to find new ways to inspire and educate visitors on the historical significance of this bygone era.\"But some Romans and cultural leaders have given the initiative an emphatic thumbs down. (Footnote: While the emperor made such a gesture to condemn a fighter in the original \"Gladiator\" movie, scholars are uncertain about the direction thumbs actually pointed in ancient arenas for such purposes.) \"We're against transforming the Col",
    "description2": "osseum into a theme park,\" said Massimiliano Smeriglio, a member of Rome's City Council. \"We're all in favour if a company decides to sponsor a monument or a restoration,\" he said, \"but it shouldn't be necessary to get anything in exchange.\"Federico Mollicone, a lawmaker with the Brothers of Italy party of PM Giorgia Meloni, dismissed the criticism as the views of a \"radical chic\" element in Rome that treated the arena \"as something sacred\". The Colosseum, he pointed out, had been built for rough-and-tumble entertainment. The center-right govt this year passed a law that supports the promotion of historical reenactments.Critics also raised questions about Airbnb's involvement at a time when many European cities are struggling to balance the needs of locals with a booming postpandemic tourist industry facilitated by accommodation platforms. This summer, the backlash against mass tourism saw protests in many cities, including Barcelona, Spain, and Athens, Greece. While Romans are frequently incensed by many issues in their city - everything from uncollected garbage to potholes - they can be particularly sensitive about the Colosseum. A kerfuffle erupted last year after Elon Musk challenged Mark Zuckerberg on social media to \"a cage match\", and it was rumored that the Colosseum could be the venue. NYT",

    "description1": "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared \"emergency martial law\" on Tuesday, accusing opposition parties of crippling governance, sympathizing with North Korea, and undermining the nation’s constitutional order.Televised address shocks the nationThe unexpected announcement, made during a televised address, caused widespread shock. While South Korea has experienced authoritarian rule in the past, it has been considered democratic since the 1980s.'Protecting constitutional order'\"To safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements... I hereby declare emergency martial law,\" Yoon stated. He defended the decision as necessary to protect the nation's constitutional order and freedoms.Budget dispute sparks tensionsThe declaration comes amid heightened disputes between Yoon's People Power Party and the opposition Democratic Party over next year’s budget. Opposition lawmakers, who hold a majority in the 300-member parliament, recently approved a downsized budget proposal, which Yoon criticized for slashing key funds.\"Our National Assembly has become a haven for criminals, a den of legislative dictatorship that seeks to paralyze the judicial and administrative systems and overturn our liberal democratic order,\" Yoon said.Opposition blamed for public safety chaosYoon accused the opposition of slashing budgets crucial for combating drug crimes and ensuring public safety. He warned that such actions had turned South Korea into \"a drug haven and a state of public safety chaos.\"Implementation of martial law unclearSpecific measures under martial law remain undisclosed, leaving questions about its implementation. Yoon emphasized the need to \"restore the country to normalcy by ge",
    "description2": "tting rid of anti-state forces.\"Opposition condemns martial lawThe opposition has fiercely criticized the move. Leader Lee Jae-myung warned of dire consequences in an online livestream, saying, \"Tanks, armored personnel carriers, and soldiers with guns and knives will rule the country. The economy of the Republic of Korea will collapse irretrievably.\" He urged citizens to gather at the National Assembly.Division among ruling party membersKorean news agency Yonhap reported that ruling party chief Han Dong-hoon opposed the declaration, calling it \"wrong\" and pledging to block it with public support. Han’s statement reflects divisions within Yoon’s own party.Heightened tensionsThe strained relationship between Yoon and the opposition reached a breaking point earlier this year when Yoon became the first president since 1987 to skip the opening ceremony of a new parliamentary term. His office cited ongoing parliamentary probes and impeachment threats as the reason for his absence.Opposition lawmakers claim that Yoon had undermined democratic processes by using his veto power against parliamentary bills and appointing loyalists to key military positions, fueling speculation about his intentions.Political polarizationThe martial law declaration has further polarized South Korea’s political landscape. Experts warn that the deepening divide could erode public trust in democratic institutions.“This confrontation has turned into a political war,” said had Choi Jin, head of the Institute for Presidential Leadership. “It’s an all-or-nothing battle that benefits no one.”Jhee Byong-kuen, a political science professor at Chosun University, had also criticized Yoon’s uncompromising leadership style, saying it exacerbates polarization and public disillusionment.",

    "description1": "Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has taken a bold step in the launch of her lifestyle brand, ‘American Riviera Orchard’, by appointing herself as CEO after months of searching for a suitable candidate. Markle, 43, reportedly struggled to find a qualified executive for the role, a challenge that was compounded by ongoing trademark issues and negotiations with Netflix over a potential partnership for the brand. The lifestyle venture, announced in March, aims to focus on home, garden, food, and lifestyle wares, though no official release date or detailed product line has been revealed yet.According to the Daily Mail, Markle's decision to take on the CEO role herself followed a prolonged search that did not yield satisfactory results. A source told columnist Richard Eden, \"She is the CEO of American Riviera Orchard.\" The outlet also noted that a partnership with Netflix could significantly shape the brand’s operations, with the streaming giant potentially appointing its own CEO if an agreement is reached. According to The Mirror, Markle’s behind-the-scenes efforts to finalise the brand and resolve trademark disputes signal a planned public comeback in 2025, with the launch of both her lifestyle brand and Netflix projects expected early in the year.Markle’s path to launching American Riviera Orchard has been fraught with difficulties. As reported by The Express, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) rejected the brand’s trademark application in September, citing the inclusion of a geographical location in its name and describing its logo as overly intricate. Markle’s team has since made adjustments, but a further protest fro",
    "description2": "m the rival lifestyle brand Harry & David in October, claiming similarity to their \"Royal Riviera\" product line, has caused additional delays.According to the New York Post, Markle recently requested a three-month extension from the USPTO to secure the brand’s trademark, a move necessary to avoid restarting the application process from scratch. These administrative hurdles, paired with Markle’s departure from public view over the last few months, have contributed to the delayed rollout of the brand’s products, which are expected to include jams, spreads, cutlery, and recipe books.Despite these setbacks, Markle has reportedly been working diligently behind the scenes to ensure her lifestyle brand’s success. Sources close to the Duchess, as cited by Page Six, stated, \"She’s been in the background working on her entrepreneurial efforts. Both the Netflix project and her brand will come out within the same timeline in the New Year.\" Markle is reportedly negotiating a partnership with Netflix that could integrate products as spin-offs from her show, potentially transforming the brand into a unique media-commerce hybrid.A rocky staffing historyMarkle’s decision to appoint herself as CEO follows a tumultuous history with staff turnover. As per the New York Post, her former chief of staff, Josh Kettler, resigned after just three months on the job, becoming the 18th staffer to leave the Sussexes’ employ over the last four years. Kettler’s resignation in August, a day before accompanying the couple on a trip to Colombia, marked the challenges Markle and Prince Harry have faced in building a stable team to execute their professional ventures.",

    "description1": "The South Korean lawmakers on Wednesday demanded that President Yoon Suk Yeol steps down or an impeachment motion will be called in parliament after he declared martial law in the country, only to reverse it hours later triggering a political crisis in Asia’s fourth-largest economy. The surprise decision by President Yoon led cabinet met with stiff opposition from the public and the lawmakers who rushed to the National Assembly in order to block the move. In a late night vote, a majority of 190 lawmakers present out of 300, including 18 members from Yoon's party voted to defy the presidential order and reverse the move. The parliamentarians of a coalition from opposition parties have said that they intend to table a bill in the National Assembly on Wednesday in order to impeach President Yoon and added that it should be voted upon within 72 hours, reported Reuters.

The main opposition party, Democratic Party, in a statement said “We will not sit idly by and watch President Yoon’s crime of destroying the Constitution and trampling on democracy. President Yoon should immediately resign voluntarily.” One of South Korea’s largest trade unions, Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) with over one million members, called for a strike against the failed martial law imposition by President Yoon and said to protest until he resigns, the BBC reported.

    "description1": "Yoon Suk Yeol Declares Martial Law Live Updates: Demonstrators on Wednesday morning gathered outside South Korea’s National Assembly to demand the resignation of President Yoon Suk Yeol, who had imposed a martial law in the country only to call it off hours later. Trade union members, opposition party are demanding that President Yoon steps down. The martial law in South Korea, which was enforced by President Yoon Suk Yeol in a surprise move, had been called-off after 190 MPs in parliament voted against it. In less than two hours of implementing the martial law, MPs had defied the president, gathering at the National Assembly and voting to block his move. Hours after President Yoon Suk Yeol declared \"emergency martial law\" in South Korea Tuesday, military troops tried to enter the Parliament, according to news agency Reuters. Yoon made the declaration in an unannounced television address, accusing the opposition of \"sympathising with North Korea\" and \"paralysing the government with anti-state activities.\" Live TV footage showed troops, who had allegedly been tasked with imposing the law, trying to enter the Assembly building. Opposition leaders, also called parliamentary aides, could also be seen attempting to prevent soldiers from entering the premises by spraying fire extinguishers on them. Parliament lifts the ma",
    "description2": "rtial law: Hours after Yoon's announcement, the Parliament voted to reject the martial law, while National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik declared it invalid, as per Reuters. Speaker Shik declared that lawmakers “will protect democracy with the people”, and called for police and military personnel to withdraw from the Assembly's grounds, The Associated Press reported. As per South Korea's constitution, the President's martial law declaration must be reviewed by the cabinet and be relayed to the National Assembly. The president must comply when the National Assembly requests the lifting of martial law by a majority vote of members. The martial law and why President Yeol imposed it: The martial law is meant to replace South Korea's civilian government and establish military rule. It also suspends civilian legal processes for military ones. Standard civil liberties may be suspended till martial law is in force. The latest National Assembly elections held in South Korea earlier this year delivered a landslide verdict for the opposition. Moreover, in recent weeks, Yoon’s conservative People Power Party had been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition Democratic Party over next year’s budget bill. The opposition has also moved to impeach three top prosecutors, thus leading to Yoon's decision to impose martial law.",

    "description1": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday declined to address questions about his controversial decision to pardon his son Hunter Biden, during his first presidential trip to Angola. The move has sparked intense political backlash in Washington, with critics highlighting Biden's reversal of previous promises not to pardon family members. During a meeting with Angolan President João Lourenço at the presidential palace, Biden dismissed shouted questions from reporters with a laugh, turning to the Angolan delegation and saying, “Welcome to America.” Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had previously stated that Biden would not take questions from the press during his trip to Africa. The pardon, which covers Hunter Biden’s actions over the past 11 years, has been criticised for contradicting Biden",
    "description2": "’s repeated assurances to the public. In June, as Hunter faced trial in a Delaware gun case, Biden said, “I abide by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him.” The White House reinforced this stance multiple times in subsequent months. Biden’s claims that his Justice Department presided over a “miscarriage of justice” in prosecuting his son have further inflamed tensions. The decision has drawn criticism even from within his Democratic Party, with many fearing it undermines their ability to challenge President-elect Donald Trump’s legal moves when he assumes office in seven weeks. The controversy has also cast a shadow over Biden's final weeks in office, raising questions about his legacy as he prepares to leave the Oval Office on January 20. (With inputs from AP)",

Biden highlighted a $3 billion US commitment to the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment project, which links Angola, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The project aims to ease the export of raw materials essential for batteries and clean energy technologies. Biden is set to visit the Atlantic Ocean outlet of the corridor in Lobito on Wednesday.

White House national security spokesperson John Kirby noted that while the project’s completion would take years, significant progress had already been made. Biden's trip includes a visit to Angola’s National Slavery Museum, housed in the historic Capela da Casa Grande, where he will address the shared history of slavery between the US and Angola. On Monday, he met Wanda Tucker, a descendant of William Tucker, the first enslaved child born in the US. William Tucker’s parents were brought to colonial Virginia from Angola in 1619 aboard the Portuguese ship White Lion. President Biden’s visit also coincides with meetings with African business leaders and discussions to enhance public-private partnerships in energy production, as expressed by President Lourenço.

    "description1": "Questions over the safety of minorities, particularly Hindus, in Bangladesh were raised shortly after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government in August. The recent arrest of a Hindu monk in the neighbouring country has once again brought these concerns to the fore. Chinmoy Krishna Das has been arrested on sedition charges. His bail hearing was set for Tuesday. However, due to the lack of a lawyer to represent him, the court has adjourned the hearing to January 2, 2025. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) has claimed that the lawyer representing Das was brutally attacked by “Islamists”. His arrest has led to protests by Hindu outfits in India, demanding his release. One such protest outside the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission at Agartala, Tripura, against Das’s arrest turned violent on Monday. A group of protesters under the aegis of the Hindu Sangarsh Samiti broke police barriers and indulged in vandalism inside the High Commission, also removing Bangladesh’s national flag from its pole. While the Ministry of External Affairs deemed the act “deeply regrettable”, its Bangladeshi counterpart urged immediate action, reminding New Delhi of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. Who is Chinmoy Krishna Das and why was he arrested? Das was once associated with ISKCON in Bangladesh. The organisation has claimed he was expelled in September for violating its rules. He is also the spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote. He had been leading rallies demanding security for Hindus. The Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote has been asking for the implementation of an eight-point list of demands, which include instituting a minority protection law, a minister for minority affairs and a special tribunal for acting swiftly on cases of minority persecution, among others. Das was arrested in Dhaka’s main airport on November 25 while travelling to Chattogram in southeastern Bangladesh. At a United Nations forum, Bangladesh for its part asserted that the arrest of the Hindu leader had been “misconstrued”. “. He was actually arrested on specific charges. The matter is being dealt with by our court of law,” said Tareq Md Ariful Islam, ambassador and permanent representative of Bangladesh to the UN and other international organisations in Geneva. “We expect that these processes will deal with the case in a just, fair, and transparent manner, ensuring full respect for the legal rights of all concerned,” Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on November 29. UK Parliamentarians highlight arrest of Hindu monk Parliamentarians in the United Kingdom have also raised concerns over Das’s arrest. Conservative MP Priti Patel highlighted the spread of violence in Bangladesh in the House of Commons and also demanded to know what is being done to secure the release of the religious leader. Labour MP Barry Gardiner underlined instances of attacks on Hindu temple",
    "description2": "s and the arrest of the Hindu monk. “The situation is clearly on a knife edge,” he said. I am deeply concerned by the awful violence we have seen in Bangladesh, and my thoughts are with those affected. In Parliament this afternoon, I called on the Government to set out how they are engaging with the Bangladeshi Government on this pressing and important issue.… pic.twitter.com/jRXciBQIKH — Priti Patel MP (@pritipatel) December 2, 2024 Responding to their queries, the parliamentary under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, Catherine West, said, “I was given assurances by the interim Government in Bangladesh that support was available for minority communities in Bangladesh in the lead up to Durga Puja—a national festival.” “The UK Government will continue to monitor the situation. and will engage with the interim Government in Bangladesh on the importance of freedom of religion or belief specifically as it affects the Hindu community,” West added. TMC urges Centre to reach out to the UN The Trinamool Congress on Tuesday brought up the issue in Parliament. During the Zero Hour in the Lok Sabha, TMC leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay said that West Bengal was directly affected by the happenings in neighbouring Bangladesh. Noting that minorities, including Hindus, are being “tortured and killed” in Bangladesh, Bandyopadhyay urged the Centre to appeal to the UN to send peacekeeping forces to the country. Earlier, West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee had made a similar appeal while speaking in the State Assembly. Growing distance between India and Bangladesh Criticising Indian authorities for lapses that led to the violence in Agartala, the law affairs adviser in Bangladesh’s interim government, Asif Nazrul, said that India needs to realise that “this is not Sheikh Hasina’s Bangladesh”. Ties between New Delhi and Dhaka have remained strained since the ouster of Hasina, who went on to seek asylum in India. In September, Mohammed Yunus, chief advisor to the interim government, had said that relations between India and Bangladesh were at “a low”. Bangladesh has also said that it will seek Hasina’s extradition from India and hold her accountable for the hundreds of deaths during the student-led protests that ended her 15-year rule. Among the factors behind the deteriorating ties between the neighbouring countries have been reports of attacks on minorities. As The Indian Express reported earlier, at least 205 incidents of attacks on members of the Hindu community were recorded in the two weeks after the fall of the Hasina government. Randhir Jaiswal during a presser last week reiterated that the Indian Government has consistently raised the issue of threats and “targeted attacks” on Hindus and other minorities with the Bangladeshi authorities. “Our position on the matter is clear—the interim government must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities,” the MEA spokesperson added.",

    "description1": "The ICC prosecutor promises that more applications will be forthcoming as the Rohingya seek justice and accountability.\nThe prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) has requested an international arrest warrant for the military ruler of Myanmar for the persecution of Rohingya.\nThe office of prosecutor Karim Khan said on Wednesday that Min Aung Hlaing, chief of the military government that took control of the country in a coup in 2021, is responsible for crimes against humanity regarding the treatment of the Rohingya minority.\nThe prosecutor’s office has been investigating alleged crimes committed during 2016-17 violence in the country’s state of Rakhine for the past five years, it said.\nAt that time, the Myanmar military unleashed a brutal crackdown on Rohingya civilians, sending at least 700,000 fleeing into neighbouring Bangladesh amid reports of killings, torture, rape and arson.\nMilitary chief Min Aung Hlaing “bears criminal responsibility for the crimes against humanity of deportation and persecution of the Rohingya, committed in Myanmar, and in part in Bangladesh”, the prosecutor’s office said.\n“My Office alleges that these crimes were committed between 25 August 2017 and 31 December 2017 by the armed forces of Myanmar, the Tatmadaw, supported by the national police, the border guard police, as well as non-Rohingya civilians,” Khan’s statement said.\n#ICC Prosecutor @KarimKhanQC addresses the Rohingya community on the application for a warrant of arrest in the situation in #Bangladesh/#Myanmar ⤵️https://t.co/OyQHr9q29r pic.twitter.com/vYSJdSNQKe\n— Int'l Criminal Court (@IntlCrimCourt) November 27, 2024\nThe work of the ICC seeks to vindicate the resilience of the mainly Muslim minority community of Rohingya – more than a million of whom were forcibly displaced by military action – and “their hope in the power of the law”, the prosecutor added.\nZin Mar Aung, foreign minister for Myanmar’s opposition National Unity Government, established by elected lawmakers barred from taking their seats in 2021, said on X that ICC judges should “swiftly issue the warrant” and that governments should “act and enforce this warrant to uphold justice and int",

The process could take several months.\nTurmoil has been building in Myanmar ever since the coup. Armed factions have fought the military government and have gradually scored victories, especially in areas near the border with China.\nThat has stirred tension with Beijing, a major arms supplier to the military government and Myanmar’s biggest trade partner. Analysts note that China also maintains ties with the ethnic armed groups which hold territory along the border.\nEarlier this month, Min Aung Hlaing embarked on his first visit to China since seizing power, with Beijing reportedly unhappy with his failure to ensure stability and halt criminality.\nUnited Nations investigators said the military campaign against the Rohingya, which involved mass killings, rapes and destruction, was carried out with “genocidal intent”. Myanmar rejects the charges.\nThis was the first application for an arrest warrant against a high-level Myanmar official issued by the ICC. The prosecutor, who was speaking from a refugee camp in Bangladesh, promised “more will follow”.\n“In doing so, we will be demonstrating, together with all of our partners, that the Rohingya have not been forgotten. That they, like all people around the world, are entitled to the protection of the law,” the British-born barrister said.\nIn 2022, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the highest court of the UN, advanced a separate case against Myanmar, brought by The Gambia, that investigates responsibility for genocide against the Rohingya.\nFive European powers and Canada last year joined the ICJ case against Myanmar, arguing they seek to “make a contribution to clarifying and combating genocide”.\nThe request for an arrest warrant on Wednesday comes shortly after the ICC issued international arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders, six months after the prosecutor sought them.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "As the threat from plastic pollution mounts, countries could only agree to postpone negotiations to a later date.\nCountries negotiating a global treaty to curb plastic pollution have failed to reach an agreement, with more than 100 nations advocating for a cap on plastic production and a handful of oil-producing countries only willing to target plastic waste.\nThe fifth United Nations Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5) meeting in Busan, South Korea was intended to be the final session. It was hoped the meeting would produce a legally binding global treaty.\nIf successful, it would have marked the most significant global climate pledge since the Paris Climate Accords in 2015, but the group of nations could only agree on Sunday to postpone negotiations to a later date.\nSaudi Arabia, in particular, was accused of standing in the way. The country strongly opposed efforts to reduce plastic production and used procedural tactics to delay progress.\n“It is clear that there is still persistent divergence,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, told the Reuters news agency.\nOne plan that received significant international support was proposed by Panama on Thursday. If adopted, it would have established a pathway for a global production reduction target, but it did not specify what that target would look like. Another proposal did not mention produc",

This delay comes with dire consequences for people and the planet, ruthlessly sacrificing those on the front lines of this crisis,” Graham Forbes, Greenpeace’s delegation head to the global plastics treaty, said in a statement.\n“This week, over 100 member states, representing billions of people, rejected a toothless deal that would have accomplished nothing and stood before the world committing to an ambitious treaty. Now, it’s time they stand by this promise and deliver.”\nThe environmental group GAIA told Reuters that “there is little assurance that the next INC will succeed where INC-5 did not”.\nThe postponement comes just days after the turbulent conclusion of the 29th UN Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan.\nAt COP29, countries pledged $300bn annually to address climate change. However, this plan fell far short of the $1.3 trillion requested by developing nations, which are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "South Korea could step back from aiding Kyiv, a proposal that was spurred by the North’s deployment to Russia.\nA laser beam downs drones by heating up and “frying” their electronics – each invisible, soundless “shot” is more precise and less costly than an air defence missile.\nHanwha Aerospace, a South Korean defence company, has fire-tested and is about to start mass-producing the world’s first-ever optical fibre laser weapon.\nAnd Hanwha is ready to supply it to Ukraine if Seoul lifts a ban on the export of lethal weapons to Kyiv “in light of North Korean military activities”, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said in late October.\nHis statement followed North Korea’s deployment of about 10,000 soldiers to western Russia, becoming the first foreign power to step into the Russia-Ukrainian war.\nHowever, the US president-elect may stand in the way.\nDonald Trump and his fledgling administration members have repeatedly said that they want to limit US military aid to Ukraine – or even stop it altogether.\nSeoul may have to follow suit, two South Korean officials told Bloomberg on Thursday.\nHowever, a member of the Ukrainian delegation that visited Seoul earlier this month doubts it.\n“I don’t think they will refuse. They seemed rather independent and self-sufficient in their diplomatic and military politics,” Roman Bochkala, co-founder of a Ukrainian charity fund that delivers arms and other crucial supplies to the front line, told Al Jazeera.\n“It’s paramount to [South] Korea to maximally compensate for the potential danger of real combat experience the North Korean army might get,” he said.\nAnother Ukrainian analyst agreed – but said that Seoul may not sell other lethal weaponry to Kyiv.\n“Such [weaponry] will most likely not be limited, but we will have to pay for it,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. “But Seoul will hardly make artillery shells for us. And won’t send any tanks.”\nSouth Korea has reportedly supplied hundreds of thousands of artillery shells via the United States and pledged a $2.3bn low-interest loan to Kyiv.\nSeoul is the world’s 10th-largest arms exporter, and its clients already include four nations that border Russia – Poland, Estonia, Finland and Norway.\nBut Kyiv may be the first to receive the lasers in what could significantly knock down the price of Ukraine’s air defence.\n“[South] Koreans swear that their laser will fry enemy drones with an almost 100 percent guarantee, destroying engines or other electronic equipment within 10-20 seconds,” Bochkala said.\nThe South Korean systems will supplement Patriots, advanced air defence systems that cost $1bn each and need $4m missiles that are often spent on downing Russia’s $50,000 drones.\nThe laser needs nothing but electricity – and could be deployed to the Ukrainian cities that have no Patriots or similar Western or Taiwanese air defence systems.\n“There are never too many good friends. And South Korea may become one for Ukraine,” Bochkala said.\nIn early August, Ukrainian forces seized a chunk of Russia’s westernmost Kursk region – and have held on to most of it.\nKyiv hoped that Moscow would deploy troops from the front lines of the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas to repel the surpri",

Now, they’re volunteering in droves, because the motherland is in danger,” a Moscow resident told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.\nBut it took the Kremlin weeks to start the counteroffensive as it kept on pushing in Donbas, taking several crucial towns and villages.\nNorth Korean soldiers joined the fray earlier this month, according to Western and Ukrainian intelligence and officials.\n“It significantly boosts the enemy’s potential,” Lieutenant-General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera.\nHowever, Moscow decided not to concentrate the North Koreans in one place instead deploying small groups to Russian units.\n“They are not collected in one fist, which would have been more effective had there been a [North Korean] division or a brigade,” Romanenko said.\nWith some 1.3 million servicemen and millions of reservists, North Korea has one of the world’s largest armies.\nIt is armed with Soviet-era weaponry or its domestically produced replicas.\nAnd though the Kursk deployment may look sensational, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in fact “mirrors” what a South Korean leader did half a century ago, according to analyst Kushch.\nBetween 1964 and 1973, when South Korea was poorer and less industrialised than the pro-Communist North, South Korean President Park Chong-hee deployed some 350,000 soldiers to Washington’s war Vietnam – along with tens of thousands of workers.\nIn exchange, he secured multibillion-dollar US investments, credits and technology transfers that helped turn South Korea into one of the world’s most technologically advanced and affluent nations.\nVietnam accused South Koreans of war crimes, but Park paid no heed as the economic boom helped him cement his grip on power.\nKim Jong Un is equally unceremonious as Moscow props his nation’s economy with billions of dollars paid for arms and ammunition, discounted supplies of energy, food and technologies.\nKim’s Kursk deployment may become a powerful bargaining chip in the ceasefire talks with President-elect Donald Trump’s future administration.\n“Putin will reserve a Korean trump card up his sleeve before future talks with Trump – or for the final attack in the Kursk region that for now seems to be maximally delayed,” Kushch said.\nEarlier this week, Ukrainian troops in Kursk repelled a massive Russian advance and reported first losses among North Koreans.\nThe deployment may look like Putin’s weakness amid reports of a dire shortage of manpower, but the consensus in Russia is: “Let them fight instead of us,” according to Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Kyiv-based Penta think tank.\nMeanwhile, the rapprochement between Moscow and Pyongyang likely irks Beijing, North Korea’s main backer, according to Fesenko.\n“North Korea is eluding China’s monopolistic influence, and Russia’s clout in Beijing’s own back yard is on the rise,” he told Al Jazeera.\nThere is also a significant risk of escalation on the Korean Peninsula as “after battle-testing his troops in a real war, Kim may get excited by the smell of blood,” Fesenko said.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Investigation is part of a broader probe into military corruption that unseated Dong’s two predecessors.\nChina has launched an investigation of Defence Minister Dong Jun due to suspicion of corruption, according to reports.\nCiting current and former US officials familiar with the situation, British newspaper The Financial Times said on Wednesday that Dong is the latest official to be caught up in a broad crackdown on corruption in the country’s military.\nFor the meantime, the report is unconfirmed. When asked about the FT report at a news briefing, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Mao Ning said it was “chasing shadows”.\nChina’s military has undergone a sweeping anticorruption purge since last year, with at least nine People’s Liberation Army (PLA) generals and several defence industry executives removed from the national legislative body to date.\nDong would be the third Chinese defence minister in a row to fall under investigation for corruption, unnamed US officials told the FT.\nDong, a former PLA Navy chief, was appointed defence minister in December 2023.\nHe is responsible for China’s military diplomacy with other nations. He oversaw a recent thaw in US-China military ties, with both nations holding theatre-level commander talks for the first time in September.\nDong’s predecessor, Li Shangfu, was removed after seven months into the job, and then expelled from the Communist Party, for offences that included bribery, according to state media. He has not been seen in public since",
    "description2": ".\nLi’s predecessor, Wei Fenghe, was also kicked out of the party and passed on to prosecutors for alleged corruption.\nA Communist Party statement at the time said the pair “betrayed the trust of the party and the Central Military Commission, seriously polluted the political environment of the military, and caused great damage to … the image of its senior leaders”.\nThey were found to have received huge sums of money in bribes and to have “sought personnel benefits” for others, the statement said.\nAccording to experts, this is a blow to the party and the role.\n“It’s certainly a blow … because one would imagine they will be super careful to have someone very clean in this role,” Dylan Loh, an assistant professor at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, told the AFP news agency.\n“Graft probes are very commonly targeted at the military because of the long historical ties between the business world and the PLA,” he said.\nAt least two other high-ranking officers connected to the Rocket Force, a relatively new unit of the Chinese military, have also been removed for corruption.\nVictor Shih, an expert on China’s elite politics, told AFP that Dong “likely had authority over tens of billions in procurement per year” during his time in the navy.\n“The problem is that competition for top positions is so fierce that there might be some mutual recriminations between officers, which would lead to endless cycles of arrests, new appointments and recriminations,” he said.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Former Israeli army chief and defence minister says northern Gaza is being ‘cleared of Arabs’, echoing ICC allegations.\nFormer Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon has accused Israel of committing war crimes and ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip, echoing the allegations by the International Criminal Court against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant.\nYaalon, a former army chief of staff, told Israeli media that hardliners in Netanyahu’s far-right cabinet were looking to chase Palestinians from northern Gaza and wanted to re-establish Jewish settlements there.\n“I am compelled to warn about what is happening there and is being concealed from us,” Yaalon told public broadcaster Kan on Sunday.\n“At the end of the day, war crimes are being committed.”\nIn an interview with the private DemocratTV channel, Yaalon said, “The road we are being led down is conquest, annexation and ethnic cleansing.”\nPressed on the “ethnic cleansing” appraisal, he said: “What is happening there? There is no more Beit Lahiya, no more Beit Hanoon, the army intervenes in Jabalia and in reality, the land is being cleared of Arabs.”\nYaalon served as defence minister under Netanyahu from 2013 to 2016 and has been a fierce critic of the prime minister ever since.\nNetanyahu’s Likud party accused him of spreading “slanderous lies”, while Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, head of a small rightist party, said his accusations were baseless.\nThe ICC last month issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict.\nPalestinians have long accused Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing in Gaza during the ongoing conflict.\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, Palestinian-American historian Rashid Khalidi, the Edward Said professor emeritus ",
    "description2": "of modern Arab studies at Columbia University, said the “genocide” happening in Gaza since October 2023 is “worse than any phase of Palestinian history”.\nIn recent weeks, the Israeli military has intensified attacks on northern Gaza, saying they are targeting Hamas fighters who have regrouped, forcing civilians to flee the area. United Nations agencies say Palestinians are suffering from more than a month of military siege in the north.\nOn Thursday, Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf visited the Gaza border and backed an initiative to re-establish settlements in the enclave.\n“Jewish settlement here is the answer to the terrible [October 7, 2023] massacre and the answer to the International Criminal Court in The Hague,” Goldknopf was quoted as saying in Israeli media.\nMost world powers deem settlements built in territory Israel seized in the 1967 war as illegal and see their expansion as an obstacle to peace, since they eat away at land the Palestinians want for a future state.\nOn Sunday, leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) reiterated their calls for an “immediate and permanent” ceasefire in Gaza during their meeting in Kuwait.\nThe leaders “condemned in the strongest terms the shocking and horrific crimes committed by Israeli occupation forces in the Gaza Strip as part of a genocide and ethnic cleansing agenda” against Palestinians.\nThey also welcomed the ICC arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant.\nAs negotiations continue for an elusive ceasefire, Israeli forces struck Beit Lahyia on Monday, killing at least 10 more Palestinians.\nIsrael’s genocide in Gaza has killed at least 44,429 Palestinians and wounded 105,250 since October 7, 2023. At least 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks that day, and more than 200 were taken captive.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Boulos is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter Tiffany and led campaign outreach to Arab and Muslim Americans.\nUnited States President-elect Donald Trump has selected Lebanon-born billionaire Massad Boulos as his senior White House adviser for Arab and Middle Eastern affairs, citing the businessman’s outreach to Arab Americans during the election campaign.\nThe announcement of the appointment on Sunday comes as the Trump administration continues to take shape, particularly in terms of the officials who will oversee US policy in the Middle East, although the purview of Boulos’s role was not immediately clear.\nBefore the selection of Boulos, who is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter Tiffany, the president-elect tapped pro-Israel hawk Marco Rubio as his nominee for secretary of state; Mike Huckabee, a staunch supporter of illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, as his ambassador to Israel; and friend Steven Witkoff, a businessman with scant policy experience, as special envoy to the Middle East.\nIn a statement on Trump’s Truth Social platform, the president-elect hailed Boulos as “an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the International scene”.\n“Massad is a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East. He will be a strong advocate for the United States, and its interests, and I am pleased to have him on our team!” Trump wrote.\nBoulos was a key figure in the Trump campaign’s outreach to the Arab American community and sought to capitalise on outrage over President Joe Biden’s continued support for Israel during the war in Gaza and, more recently, Israel’s invasion of Lebanon.\nIt was a difficult balancing act. Trump had repeatedly promised to end the war in Gaza and prevent further escalation but had long been the preferred candidate of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government.\nDuring his first term from 2017 to 2021, Trump had fully embraced Israel, moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, long seen as the capital of a future Palestinian state; recognising Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights in Syria; forging a series of normalisation agreements between Israel and Arab countries; and allowing for the rapid expansion of Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.\nHis selection of Huckabee",
    "description2": " – an evangelical Christian minister who in 2008 said there is “no such thing as a Palestinian” – has signalled the makings of a similarly permissive approach in his second term.\nBoulos also sought to calm concerns over Trump’s 2017 bans on travellers from several Muslim-majority countries, a swiftly reversed executive order seen as blatantly discriminatory.\nBoulos’s efforts received mixed marks from leaders in the large Arab American community in Michigan, a key battleground state.\nSome embraced Trump, identifying with his socially conservative message or just seeking to punish Biden, while others derided Boulos for failing to give specifics about how Trump would chart a different path than Biden in the region.\nStill, the election saw a historic shift away from Democrats from within Arab American and Muslim American communities.\nIn Dearborn, the largest Arab American majority city in the US, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris received just half of the votes that Biden had in 2020. All told, the vice president won just over 36 percent of the vote in the city with Trump taking more than 42 percent and Jill Stein, the Green Party’s candidate, carrying 18 percent.\nFor his part, Boulos has been largely silent on his personal views on the Middle East and has not articulated his own policy positions.\nHe was born to a politically connected Christian family in Lebanon but moved to Texas as a teenager and eventually joined his family’s business ventures in Nigeria.\nWhile The Associated Press news agency had previously reported that Boulos ran for parliament in Lebanon in 2009, he disputed that account in a recent interview with Newsweek.\nHe also pushed back that he was “a friend” of Suleiman Frangieh, a Lebanese politician with ties to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad whose presidential ambitions have been backed by the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.\nBoulos instead said he was not affiliated with any party in Lebanon but remained “acquainted with most Lebanese Christian leaders”.\nThe businessman has described himself as a longtime Republican who supported Trump in 2016. He came more firmly into Trump’s orbit after his son Michael married Trump’s daughter Tiffany.\nHis selection was announced a day after Trump said he would nominate Charles Kushner, the father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, as the US ambassador to France.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Suspension of humanitarian aid into Gaza comes as Israeli attacks kill almost 100 Palestinians in the last 24 hours.\nThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees has halted the delivery of aid through the Karem Abu Salem (known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis) crossing between Israel and Gaza because of security concerns, its chief said, as widespread hunger and deadly Israeli bombardments continue.\n“We are pausing the delivery of aid through Kerem Shalom, the main crossing point for humanitarian aid into Gaza. The road out of this crossing has not been safe for months. On 16 November, a large convoy of aid trucks was stolen by armed gangs,” UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said in a post on X.\n“Yesterday, we tried to bring in a few food trucks on the same route. They were all taken,” he added, warning hunger was “rapidly deepening” in Gaza.\nLazzarini listed how the humanitarian operation had become “unnecessarily impossible” due to “the ongoing siege, hurdles from Israeli authorities, political decisions to restrict the amounts of aid, lack of safety on aid routes and targeting of local police”.\nHe called on Israel to ensure aid flowed to Gaza and said the country “must refrain from attacks on humanitarian workers”.\nOn Thursday, the UN agency said “out of the 91 attempts the agency has made to deliver aid to besieged north Gaza between October 6 and November 25, 82 have been denied and 9 impeded.”\nIsrael has been accused of using starvation as a weapon of war as it has restricted supplies of food, medicine and other essential items into Gaza since launching the war last October. More than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed in nonstop Israeli bombardment since then.\nLouise Wateridge, the UNRWA emergency officer, told Al Jazeera that the targeting of aid convoys has been happening since May.\n“That has led to desperation of people, who don’t have what they need and it has led and forced criminal activities,” she stressed.\nThe pause in the delivery of aid also follows an Israeli attack o",
    "description2": "n Saturday that killed three contractors of the US charity World Central Kitchen (WCK). The Israeli military claimed one of the contractors was involved in Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack.\nHowever, the WCK said it had “no knowledge that any individual in the vehicle had alleged ties” to the Hamas attack.\nThe UN said last month that 333 aid workers had been killed since the start of the war in October of last year, 243 of them employees of UNRWA.\nIsrael, which imposed a total siege on Gaza in the early stages of the war last year, blames the inability of relief organisations to handle and distribute large quantities of aid.\nHamas’s Interior Ministry in Gaza have responded to the looting, saying more than 20 of the gang members suspected of carrying out the robbery had been killed by its security forces acting in coordination with tribal committees.\nMeanwhile, Palestinians in Gaza have told Al Jazeera of their confusion over how, in one of the most heavily surveilled territories on the planet, the presence of so many armed men could have gone undetected by Israeli forces.\nThe Washington Post had previously reported that an internal UN memo from October said the gangs in Gaza “may be benefitting from a passive if not active benevolence” or “protection” from the Israeli army.\nOne gang leader, the memo said, had established a “military-like compound” in an area “restricted, controlled and patrolled by the IDF (Israeli army)”.\nAs this developed, Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that nearly 100 people were killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza in the last 24 hours.\nThe casualties include those killed in an Israeli strike on a home belonging to the al-Araj family in the Tal az-Zaatar neighbourhood, which housed more than 40 people.\nIsrael’s genocide in Gaza has killed at least 44,382 Palestinians and wounded 105,142 since October 7, 2023. At least 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks that day, and more than 200 were taken captive.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Demonstrations spread across the country over ruling party’s path away from EU membership, shift towards Russia.\nDemonstrators in Georgia have taken to the streets for a fourth night in growing protests against the government’s decision to suspend talks on joining the European Union.\nThe protests on Sunday topped months of tensions fuelled by critics of the ruling Georgian Dream party, which some charge has moved the country away from its path towards greater integration with Europe and instead towards Russia.\nThe unrest kicked into overdrive after the government last week announced it would freeze EU talks for four years. Protesters have further condemned the police response – which has included the use of tear gas and water cannon – as excessive.\nOn Sunday, the outrage was further stoked by Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze’s rejection of appeals to hold new parliamentary elections.\nWhen asked if the vote would be held again, he told reporters: “Of course not.”\nHe added that “the formation of the new government based on the October 26 parliamentary elections has been completed.”\nStill, the opposition continues to condemn the vote. President Salome Zurabishvili, who supports joining the EU, has asked the Constitutional Court to annul the election results and declared the new legislature and government “illegitimate”.\nSpeaking to the AFP news agency on Saturday, Zurabishvili, whose term ends this month, said she would not step aside until the elections are rerun.\nGeorgian Dream has nominated far-right former football international Mikheil Kavelashvili for the presidential post, which is largely ceremonial.\nOn Sunday, protesters again gathered in the capital, Tbilisi, predominantly on the central Rustaveli Avenue, with many waving EU and Georgian flags. Some wore diving masks to protect themselves against tear gas.\nBut the demonstrations appeared to be spreading as Georgian media reported protests in at least eight cities and towns.\nIn the Black Sea city of Poti, protesters blocked an access road to the country’s main commercial port, according to the Interpress news agency.\nOpposition TV channel Formula also showed footage of people in Kh",

Usually this sort of thing ends very badly.”\nGeorgia has leaned strongly towards Europe and the West since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Its move away from Moscow was hastened by a brief war with Russia in 2008.\nLast year, it became an official candidate for EU membership and has been promised eventual NATO membership.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Social Democratic Alliance wins the largest share of votes but will need to form a coalition to govern.\nIceland’s centre-left Social Democratic Alliance has won the most votes in snap elections prompted by the collapse of the coalition in power for the past seven years, the final count shows.\nThe Social Democrats won 15 seats in the 63-seat parliament, the Althingi, with 20.8 percent of the votes, state broadcaster RUV reported on Sunday.\nThe conservative Independence Party, which led the outgoing government, won 14 seats with a 19.4 percent vote share, and the centrist Liberal Reform Party won 11 seats and 15.8 percent of the votes. Three other parties also won seats.\nIcelanders voted on Saturday after disagreements over immigration, energy policy and the economy forced Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson to pull the plug on his coalition government and call early elections.\nThis weekend’s results more than doubled the share the Social Democrats won in the previous election in 2021.\n“I’m extremely proud of all the work that we’ve done. We obviously see that people want to see changes in the political landscape,” Social Democratic leader Kristrun Mjoll Frostadottir said as results started coming in.\nFrostadottir, 36, will likely try to seek coalition partners to command a parliamentary majority.\n“It very much depends on whether she can convince the president that she is the most likely to be able to form a coalition,” Stefania Oskarsdottir, a political scientist at the University of Icelan",
    "description2": "d, told the Reuters news agency.\n“It seems that the Reform Party is critical in this because they have the option of joining a coalition with the Social Democrats and the People’s Party, and they also have the option of forming a coalition with the Independence Party and the Centre Party,” Oskarsdottir said.\nThe Pirate Party lost all of its seats in this election, meaning that only six parties will have seats in the new parliament.\nFrostadottir has pledged to address the country’s cost of living crisis, which has been caused by inflation and high borrowing costs – a challenge faced by countries worldwide in recent years and a thorn in the side of incumbent parties, including the Democrats in the United States.\nIn February 2023, inflation peaked at 10.4 percent in Iceland. While inflation slowed to 5.1 percent in October, it is still significantly higher than in much of the rest of the world.\nBy comparison, inflation in the US stood at 2.6 percent last month while the European Union’s rate was 2.3 percent\nPublic finances have also been strained by repeated volcanic eruptions in southwestern Iceland, which have displaced thousands of people. Migration has also been a key issue in this election, as Iceland struggles to accommodate asylum seekers.\nThe number of refugees seeking protection in Iceland jumped to more than 4,000 in each of the past three years, compared with a previous average of fewer than 1,000. Iceland has a population of fewer than 400,000 residents.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Russian and Syrian jets reportedly attack Idlib city on fifth day of opposition’s surprise advance in northwest Syria.\nSyrian opposition fighters say they are pushing towards the northern city of Hama after taking control of nearby Aleppo in a lightning offensive that started last week.\nThe attempted southern advance on Sunday comes on the fifth day of the surprise rebel offensive as Syrian and Russian forces have launched counterattacks, reportedly pounding opposition-controlled Idlib province and Aleppo with air attacks since Saturday.\nGovernment forces under the control of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have also been fortifying the northern province of Hama, according to the Syrian state news agency, SANA. It reported the army overnight pushed back opposition fighters in its northern countryside. Forces there were being resupplied with heavy equipment and rocket launchers, according to SANA.\nOn Sunday, United Nations special envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, appealed for all stakeholders in the conflict to immediately seek a political resolution.\n“The latest developments pose severe risks to civilians and have serious implications for regional and international peace and security,” he said.\nThe fighting marks the most significant turn in years in the Syrian war, which began with popular uprisings across the country in 2011. Since 2020, the front lines had largely been stagnant with an array of rebel groups largely contained to a small portion of Idlib province.\nBut on Friday, opposition fighters led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) entered Aleppo, prompting government forces to withdraw from the strategically significant city of more than 2 million people.\nThe opposition forces have since claimed several strategic victories, including taking control of the supply-line town of Khanasir, the Aleppo Industrial City, Aleppo’s military academy and the field artillery college.\nFormerly known as al-Nusra Front, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, HTS has distanced itself from the group while becoming the strongest opposition movement in northwestern Syria.\nIt is still considered a “terrorist” organisation by the United States, Syria and Russia.\nIn his first public comments since the start of the offensive, released late on Saturday, al-Assad said his forces would continue to defend the government’s “stability and territorial integrity against terrorists and their supporters”.\nHe said that Syria can defeat the opposition groups, no matter how much their a",

Still, it’s very dynamic, very volatile on the ground.”\nThe government said the air strikes on opposition-controlled areas were targeting weapons depots and rebel strongholds.\nHowever, the United Kingdom-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Russian strikes hit camps for displaced people on Sunday, killing eight civilians and wounding 50.\nThe White Helmets, officially the Syrian Civil Defence, said that at least 25 people, including 10 children, had been killed in air strikes carried out by the Syrian government and Russia on Sunday.\nYears of war in Syria have created one of the world’s largest displacement crises with thousands more people reported displaced in the latest fighting.\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, Razan Saffour, a British-Syrian human rights activist with family in Aleppo, said that while there is relative stability in Aleppo, there is fear over the response from the government and Russian forces.\nRussia’s military intervention in the country, starting in 2015, as well as Iran’s two years earlier helped to turn the tide of the war in favour of al-Assad. Russia’s aerial bombardments of Aleppo then helped government forces take full control of the city in 2016.\n“We’re speaking about rebel groups who are gaining Syrian territory at a very, very fast pace, but at the same time, they don’t have air defences,” she said.\n“And when we’ve seen this happen [previously], … the al-Assad regime, Russia and their ally Iran responded with a scorched earth policy.”\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was to travel to Damascus on Sunday, telling reporters Tehran would back al-Assad.\nJordan’s King Abdullah II and United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan also expressed solidarity with al-Assad in recent calls with him.\nStill, Saffour said that beyond the confusion and fear, there is also a sense of anticipation among some residents of Aleppo who had lived for years under government control.\n“We’re very apprehensive, but we’re also very excited and very hopeful to see what’s going to come next,” she said.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "The proposal passed both houses of Mexico’s Congress, leading critics to fear weakened government transparency.\nAn evening vote in Mexico’s Senate to dismantle seven independent government watchdogs has ignited controversy, with the country’s political opposition accusing the governing Morena Party of violating democratic principles.\nOn Friday, the leader of the right-leaning Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) took to social media to express his outrage.\n“The elimination of these autonomous organisations represents a direct attack against the rights of Mexicans and even democracy itself,” Alejandro Moreno Cardenas, the PRI’s president, wrote.\nHe praised the seven watchdogs as “pillars of transparency and accountability that guaranteed to the people of Mexico access to clear information about the actions of the government”.\nHis comments came after Mexico’s Senate held a vote on Thursday to fold the seven oversight bodies into existing executive agencies, under Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum.\nSheinbaum and her fellow Morena Party members have described the reform as a chance to cut down on government bureaucracy and reduce spending.\nHowever, critics fear the dissolution of the watchdog agencies will make the government more vulnerable to corruption and weaken public confidence in Mexican democracy.\n“We will firmly defend the transparency and rights of our country. Mexico does not deserve to go backwards!” Moreno Cardenas said, accusing the Morena Party of an “authoritarian” streak.\nOne of the agencies in the crosshairs is Mexico’s Institute for Information Access and Transparency (INAI), which played a key role in pushing the government to release information about the 2014 Ayotzinapa case, which saw the kidnapping of 43 college students.\nMexico’s military had been implicated in the kidnapping, and the government investigation was marred by allegations of false evidence and coerced confessions.\nOther organisations earmarked for dissolution are the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE), the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) and the National Commission for the Continuing Improvement of Education (MEJOREDU).\nThe bill to disband these government bodies passed through the lower house of Mexico’s Congress, the Chamber of Deputies, last week after a tense debate. A total of 347 deputies voted in favour and 128 against.\nThe Senate on Thursday likewise advanced the measure, by a vote of 86 to 42.\nThe proposal now goes to the individual states to approve: Mexico has 31 states and one federal entity for the capital, Mexico City. At least 17 of their governments must back the measure for it to be successful.\nBut with a majority of state legislatures controlled by the Morena Party, the measure is likely to pass. Already, the state government of Zacatecas, as well as the government of Mexico City have approved the reforms.\nThe elimination of the seven watchdogs",
    "description2": " has been a longstanding priority of the Morena Party — and particularly its popular figurehead, former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.\nDuring his six-year term, which ended in September, Lopez Obrador repeatedly clashed with oversight agencies like INAI, accusing the body of wasteful spending, bloated salaries and political bias. He ultimately unveiled plans to dismantle INAI in 2021.\nHis successor Sheinbaum, a close political ally, has carried forward several of his key legislative priorities, including the plan to disband INAI.\nSpeaking at a morning news briefing, Sheinbaum defended the Morena Party’s push to fold the seven watchdogs, paying special mention to INAI.\n“There will be more transparency now. The dissolution of INAI as an autonomous body will end corruption and will develop a system of transparency where people can easily access information on everything the Mexican government does,” Sheinbaum said.\nBut media rights groups and government transparency organisations have denounced the move as a threat to Mexican democracy.\nEarlier this month, for instance, the Mexican Association for the Right to Information (AMEDI) issued a statement expressing its “rejection” of the proposal.\n“The technical autonomy and political independence of these bodies is a fundamental principle for the democratic functioning of our society,” AMEDI said.\n“Subordinating the functions of these bodies to the federal executive branch or related agencies increases the risk of politicisation and threatens the impartiality of decisions that affect all citizens.”\nFernando Nieto-Morales, a professor at the Colegio de Mexico, likewise called the move an erosion of “critical institutional checks and balances” in an article for the Wilson Center, a US-based think tank.\n“This impending constitutional reform represents a profound setback for Mexico’s democratic trajectory,” he wrote.\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, journalist and author Manu Ureste emphasised the importance of groups like INAI.\nHe and other journalists sent more than 500 freedom of information requests to INAI in recent years to expose a government embezzlement scandal, popularly known as the “master scam”, that used fake companies to launder public money.\n“Without this transparency tool, we would never have known about this ‘master scam’ or many other such cases. I think it is a key part of Mexican democracy,” Ureste said.\nThe fate of the millions of documents in INAI’s possession now remains unclear. Hours before the Senate’s vote, the head of INAI, Adrian Alcala, spoke to Al Jazeera’s Julia Galiano about the importance of his agency’s work.\n“There is nothing comparable to INAI in the world,” Alcala said.\n“Developed countries with advanced democracies look to the Mexican model when it comes to transparency. It is legally and institutionally robust. It’s been effective in bringing some order to this country and also in fighting corruption.”\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "‘Trump is back, and it’s a sign we’ll be back, too,’ Brazil’s ex-president tells WSJ amid coup attempt accusations.\nBrazil’s former President Jair Bolsonaro has expressed hope that United States President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January will help bolster his own political comeback, amid accusations that he took part in a failed coup in the South American nation.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported late on Thursday that Bolsonaro is banking on Trump pressuring Brazil with sanctions to delay enforcing a court ruling that bars him from office until 2030 for baselessly attacking the country’s voting system before the 2022 elections he lost.\n“Trump is back, and it’s a sign we’ll be back, too,” Bolsonaro said in an interview with the US newspaper.\nBolsonaro’s remarks come just days after Brazilian police released a report implicating the former president in an alleged criminal organisation designed to overturn the 2022 election that he lost to his left-wing rival, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\nBolsonaro “planned, acted and was directly and effectively aware of the actions of the criminal organisation aiming to launch a coup d’etat and eliminate the democratic rule of law”, the report said.\nThe former army captain, who served as president from 2019 to 2022, has denied any wrongdoing and claimed to be the victim of a politically motivated witch-hunt.\nDespite the coup accusations and other investigations against him, Trump’s electoral victory earlier this month in the US has injected new energy into Brazil’s far-right and stirred hopes that Bolsona",
    "description2": "ro can mirror his return to power.\nBolsonaro often expressed admiration for Trump during the Republican’s first term in office from 2017 to 2021, and he was widely dubbed “Trump of the Tropics” during his own presidency.\nSimilarly to Trump, who continues to say the 2020 election he lost to President Joe Biden was stolen from him, Bolsonaro spent months in the run-up to the 2022 vote in Brazil falsely claiming that the country’s voting system was vulnerable to widespread fraud.\nShortly after his left-wing challenger Lula took office in January 2023, thousands of Bolsonaro’s supporters who were angered over the election results stormed the presidential palace, Congress and the Supreme Court in the capital, Brasilia.\nThe attack drew comparisons to the insurrection in the US two years earlier, on January 6, 2021, when a group of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building in Washington, DC, to prevent Congress from certifying Biden’s election victory.\nGuilherme Casaroes, professor at the Fundacao Getulio Vargas’s Sao Paulo School of Business Administration, said this week that Brazilian conservatives “are hoping [Trump] will use the threat of sanctions and other punitive measures to put pressure on Brazilian authorities to allow” Bolsonaro to run for president in 2026.\n“Even if the threat of US sanctions doesn’t by itself change judicial outcomes in Brazil, a global chorus of sympathy for Bolsonaro may, in fact, help him politically in Brazil, fuelling a sense of grievance and popular desire for his return”, Casaroes wrote in Americas Quarterly.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Mexico emphasises interconnectedness of economic ties with US – and the mutual threat of tariffs.\nMexico’s president and economy minister have given the clearest picture yet of how their government will respond to United States President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on the country, which their government has warned will cost 400,000 US jobs.\nSpeaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said the Mexican response would be swift if Trump followed through on the plans.\n“If there are US tariffs, Mexico would also raise tariffs,” Sheinbaum said.\nThe comments were the latest response to Trump’s statement on Monday that he plans to impose massive tariffs not just on China, but on Canada and Mexico as well, at a whopping 25-percent rate.\nEconomy Minister Marcelo Ebrard also warned against Trump starting a regional trade war, calling the cost to US workers “huge”.\n“Around 400,000 jobs will be lost” in the US, he said, pointing to a study based on figures from US carmakers that manufacture in Mexico.\nHe added the impact would extend beyond workers to US consumers. For example, Ebrard said, most pick-up trucks sold in the US are manufactured in Mexico. He claimed Trump’s tariffs would add $3,000 to the cost of a new vehicle.\n“That is why we say that it would be a shot in the foot,” he said.\nTrump has promised to use tariffs to bolster the US manufacturing industry – an attempt at a hard reset that economists have cast doubt on.\nStill, the severity of the president-elect’s approach to Canada and Mexico, who along with China make up the US’s top three trading partners, has come as somewhat of a surprise.\nIn his statement on Monday, Trump said he would impose the 25-percent tariffs if the three countries do not do more to address irregular migration and drug smuggling into the US.\nSheinbaum had previously called the threats “unacceptable”.\nOn Wednesday, Sheinbaum revealed she held a call with Trump to discuss migration across the US-Mexico border, where ",
    "description2": "she attempted to assuage his fears.\n“I had an excellent conversation with President Donald Trump,” Sheinbaum posted on social media. “We discussed Mexico’s strategy on the migrant phenomenon, and I shared that caravans are not arriving at the northern border because they are being taken care of in Mexico.”\nOfficials have also warned Trump’s tariffs likely run afoul of the free trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada, the USMCA, which prohibits most duties on trade between the three countries.\nTrump himself had renegotiated the agreement during his first term, complaining that US businesses were getting a raw deal.\nSheinbaum has requested a meeting with Trump before he takes office on January 20.\nFor his part, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had already spoken with Trump about the tariff threat, stressing the longstanding ties between the two countries.\n“We talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together. It was a good call,” he said. “This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on, and that’s what we’ll do.”\nGovernment officials have not been the only ones who have warned of the impact of the proposed tariffs on US companies and consumers.\nAnalysts at Barclays have said they estimate the proposed tariffs “could wipe out effectively all profits” from the “Detroit Three” automakers: GM, Stellantis and Ford.\n“While it’s generally understood that a blanket 25 percent tariff on any vehicles or content from Mexico or Canada could be disruptive, investors under-appreciate how disruptive this could be,” they wrote in a note on Tuesday.\nTrump’s team, for its part, has remained defiant.\nBrian Hughes, a spokesperson for Trump’s transition team, told the Reuters news agency the tariffs would protect US manufacturers and workers from “unfair practices of foreign companies and foreign markets”.\nHe contended Trump would implement policies he said would make life affordable and more prosperous for the US.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "The US says its sanctions target 21 individuals involved in anti-democratic practices and the repression of protests.\nThe United States has announced sanctions against 21 allies of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, citing alleged involvement in the suppression of protests following a contested July election.\nOfficials with the US Department of the Treasury said on Wednesday that the harsh crackdown, in which at least 25 protesters were killed, was an effort to stifle dissent. More than 2,400 protesters were arrested during the demonstrations.\n“Maduro and his representatives’ repressive actions in the wake of the Venezuelan presidential election are a desperate attempt to silence the voices of its citizens,” Bradley Smith, the acting undersecretary of the Treasury Department, said in a statement.\nVenezuela, meanwhile, dismissed Wednesday’s sanctions as a “desperate act”.\nThe sanctions come months after a July 28 presidential election in which Maduro claimed victory, despite pre-election polling showing him losing by an insurmountable margin.\nWhen the election results were announced without the usual breakdown of votes, the opposition denounced the tally as fraudulent. It published copies of ballot sheets online that it said proved opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez won the race.\nInternational observers also questioned the election results. “Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election did not meet international standards of electoral integrity and cannot be considered democratic,” The Carter Center, a US-based nonprofit, wrote in a news release afterwards.\nLast week, the administration of US President Joe Biden recognised Gonzalez as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. It is unclear what effect that announcement, along with the new round of sanctions, will have on Venezuela.\nA separate news release from the US Depart",
    "description2": "ment of State said that the sanctions target “members of the security forces and cabinet-level officials” who “undermined a competitive and inclusive electoral process in Venezuela or are responsible for acts of repression”.\n“Maduro’s security apparatus has engaged in widespread abuses, including killings, repression and mass detention of protestors,” the State Department wrote.\nThe release also said that such sanctions have been applied to a total of 180 current and former Venezuelan officials, including today’s batch. Nearly 2,000 people face visa restrictions for their alleged role in the electoral repression as well.\nThe Maduro government has faced growing diplomatic isolation following the election, which awarded the bus-driver-turned-president a third term in office.\nSome leaders in the region, including Brazil’s Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva and Colombia’s Gustavo Petro, had previously expressed a desire for stronger ties with Venezuela. But both men have since cast doubt on the legitimacy of Maduro’s victory and called for the release of voting tallies that could confirm the government’s claims.\nMaduro’s government has yet to release such documentation.\nOther Latin American countries, including Peru, El Salvador and Argentina, have broken relations with Venezuela in the aftermath of the election.\nStill, Venezuela does maintain diplomatic relations with many of its neighbours in Latin America. On Wednesday, Uruguay’s President-elect Yamandu Orsi indicated he would maintain ties with Maduro’s government, even though he too previously called the election results “more than suspicious”.\nThe opposition candidate Gonzalez, meanwhile, left Venezuela after the government issued a warrant for his arrest, part of a wider campaign against members of the opposition. He is currently in Spain.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

They blocked highways, attacked police headquarters in the capital Brasilia, and even were implicated in a bomb threat against the incoming president.\nTensions boiled over on January 8, 2023, a week after Lula was sworn into office.\nThousands of Bolsonaro supporters descended on the Three Powers Plaza, a square in Brasilia that houses the presidential palace, the Supreme Court and both houses of Congress.\nThey broke into the government buildings, looting and destroying property in the apparent hope of sparking a “military intervention” that would remove Lula from power.\nCritics of Bolsonaro have long questioned his role in the events, though Bolsonaro has staunchly denied participating.\nBut leaked audio recordings suggest high-ranking members of the Brazilian Army were involved in conspiring to keep Bolsonaro in power.\nOn Monday, The Associated Press obtained the audio recordings, which date from the weeks leading up to Lula’s inauguration in late 2022.\nIn the 53 recordings, some military officers can be heard expressing their desire to keep Lula from taking office.\nOne recording features Colonel Roberto Raimundo Criscuoli, a former sub-commander of the army’s special forces. He tells retired Brigadier General Mario Fernandes — who was, at the time, second in command to the general secretary of the presidency — that Bolsonaro had a clear choice about how to respond to the election.\n“It will be either a civil war now or civil war later. We have a justification now for civil war. People are on the streets. We have massive support,” Criscuoli said.\n“Let’s do this now. Speak to 01,” he said, using a code for Brazil’s president.\nSupreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the federal police’s sprawling investigation into Bolsonaro, quoted some of the recordings in a ruling last week ordering the arrest of five people for plotting the assassination of then-President-elect Lula in late 2022.\nLast week, Bolsonaro told the Brazilian news website Metropoles that police accusations were the result of “creativity”, not fact. He added his lawyers were reviewing the matter and would fight the accusations.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Justin Trudeau and Claudia Sheinbaum urge dialogue as Donald Trump plans to hit US neighbours with 25-percent tariffs.\nThe leaders of Mexico and Canada are urging dialogue and cooperation after United States President-elect Donald Trump pledged to impose 25-percent tariffs on the two countries when he takes office early next year.\nDuring a news conference on Tuesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she planned to send a letter to Trump stressing the need to work together on joint challenges.\n“To one tariff will come another and so on until we put our common businesses at risk,” Sheinbaum said, warning that tariffs would cause inflation and job losses in both countries.\nIn a post on social media on Monday evening, Trump said he planned to “charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States”.\n“This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country! Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem.”\nHe also said he planned to impose “an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs” on Beijing, which Washington views as its largest global competitor.\nTrump, who won the November 5 presidential election over his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, had repeatedly said during his 2024 campaign that he would impose increased tariffs on all imports into the US.\nThe former president and his allies have portrayed the tariffs policy as a key tool to bring back jobs and manufacturing from overseas. Experts have said, however, that the move would increase costs for Americans.\nOn Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters that he spoke with Trump on Monday evening after the Republican’s online posts. Trudeau said he stressed the longstanding ties between the two countries.\n“We talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together. It was a good call,” he said, adding: “This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on, and that’s what we’ll do.”\nThe Liberal Party leader, whose popularity has dropped significantly over the past few years amid high costs of living and a housing crisis, is under pressure from Conservative politicians at the federal and provincial levels to resolve any problems before Trump takes office.\n“The federal government needs to take the situation at our border seriously,” right-wing Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a social media post on Monday night.\nDanielle Smith, the right-wing premier of Canada’s oil-producing province of Alberta, also said Trump had “valid concerns” about the US-Canada land border, which stretches 6,416km (3,987 miles).\nA 25 per cent tariff would be devastating to workers and jobs in both Canada and the U.S.\nThe federal government needs to take the situation at our border seriously.

    "description2": "he largest exporter of oil and gas to the US, we look forward to working with the new administration to strengthen energy security for both the US and Canada,” she wrote on X.\nTrudeau said on Tuesday that he had spoken with Ford and Quebec Premier Francois Legault and planned to convene a meeting with provincial leaders to discuss the US.\n“There’s work to do, but we know how to do it,” the prime minister added.\nTrump’s threats have already impacted the markets. The Mexican peso initially weakened almost 2 percent against the US Dollar on Tuesday, and shares have dropped in automakers, including Ford and General Motors.\nAsa McKercher, the Hudson research chair in Canada-US relations at St Francis Xavier University in Canada, noted that Trump often threatened to enact harsh policies during his first term in the White House from 2017 to 2021 but didn’t always follow through.\n“My initial thought is that this is probably some sort of negotiating tactic rather than something he actually wants to go through with — in part because it would be hugely damaging to the American economy,” McKercher told Al Jazeera of Trump’s tariffs threat.\nHe explained that the tariffs would drive up prices on many things, including oil and gas supplies from Canada as well as food imports from Mexico.\nThe US and Canada are each other’s largest trading partners, exchanging nearly $2.7bn ($3.6bn Canadian) in goods and services across their shared border daily in 2023, according to Canadian government figures.\nThe Bank of Canada said on Tuesday that if Trump follows through on his threat of tariffs on Canada, it would have an impact on both economies and the central bank would incorporate those into its economic forecasts.\nMeanwhile, US goods and services traded with Mexico totalled an estimated $855bn in 2022, the Office of the US Trade Representative said.\nThe three countries are signatories to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which they signed in 2020 when Trump was president to replace the longstanding North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n“He’s being a bully, which is what he is, and he’s making these kind of threats to see what kind of goodies he can get,” McKercher said of Trump, adding that the Republican’s remarks about fentanyl and irregular migration appear more geared towards Mexico than Canada.\n“That’s not really an issue in Canada-US relations,” he said.\nDuring her news conference, Sheinbaum said her administration had always shown Mexico’s willingness to help fight the fentanyl epidemic in the US and that apprehensions of migrants and asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border were down.\nHowever, Sheinbaum noted that criminal groups in Mexico were still receiving guns from the US. She said the region’s shared challenges require cooperation, dialogue and reciprocal understanding.\n“We do not produce weapons. We do not consume the synthetic drugs,” she said. “Unfortunately, we have the people who are being killed by crime that is responding to the demand in your country.”\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

It said the killings were a result of “the occupation’s aggression”. Israel’s military also confirmed that four Palestinians were killed, describing them as “terrorists”.\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society, meanwhile, reported that Israeli forces had been “preventing our teams from reaching the bombing site”.\nFares Irshaid, a resident of Sir, described the attack to the AFP news agency.\n“In the morning, the planes came and started bombing this area,” Irshaid said. “Shortly after that, the army stormed the entire area. They declared it a closed military zone.”\n“There was a group of young men, including my nephew and the son of our neighbours, and we do not know their fate,” he told the news agency.\nIsrael has not released the bodies of those killed although the military identified one of the dead as 31-year-old Wael Lahluh.\nThere has been a surge in Israeli military operations and violence by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank since the war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023.\nAt least 780 Palestinians have been ki",

The military said Lahluh had killed a 23-year-old settler in August.\nWhile Israeli settlements are illegal under international law and are seen as a major obstacle to a future Palestinian state, the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has continued their expansion. The military regularly intervenes to protect Israeli settlers.\nThe latest Israeli operation was carried out after Israel last month launched several raids in Jenin, killing nine people.\nTwo Palestinians, including a teenage boy, were also killed during an Israeli raid in the West Bank village of Yabad on November 24, according to the Palestinian Authority.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Appointment of a loyal aide to the FBI post could end long-running tradition of keeping presidents at arm’s length.\nUnited States President-elect Donald Trump has nominated one of his most loyal aides, Kash Patel, to run the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), drawing a sharp reaction from critics, who question his qualifications and impartiality to hold the position.\nPatel, an outspoken critic of the FBI like his boss, has been entrusted to lead the country’s most important federal law enforcement agency.\nThe 44-year-old has steadfastly promoted the idea of the existence of a “deep state” and the belief the agency is biased against Trump. He has pushed to overhaul the agency.\nWith the nomination of Patel, Trump also signals that he is preparing to carry out his threat to oust Christopher Wray, a Republican he first appointed in 2017 and whose 10-year term does not expire until 2027.\nKashyap Pramod Vinod Patel, commonly known as Kash, was born in the city of New York, a child of immigrant parents originally from the Indian state of Gujarat.\nPatel graduated in law in 2005 from Pace University after earning a certificate in international law from the University College London a year prior. Before that, he finished his bachelor’s degree in criminal justice and history from the University of Richmond.\nAccording to his US Department of Defense biography, Patel is “a life-long ice hockey player, coach, and fan”.\nAs a 40-year-old lawyer with little government experience, Patel joined the administration of then-President Trump in 2019, rising rapidly from the ranks by showing what some media described as his complete devotion to Trump.\n“Each new title set off new alarms,” according to The Atlantic describing Patel. Once, then-CIA Director Gina Haspel had reportedly threatened to resign after Trump said he wanted to appoint Patel as deputy CIA director.\nPatel served in key roles during Trump’s first term, including overseeing the counterterrorism division at the National Security Council and later serving as chief of staff at the Department of Defense.\nBefore his White House roles, Patel worked on the House Intelligence Committee in Congress, where he played a significant role in the investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\nShortly after Trump left office, Patel launched Fight with Kash, an organisation that funds defamation lawsuits and peddles a wide variety of merchandise, including branded socks and other clothing with the “K$H” logo.\nPatel has also authored children’s books that lionise Trump – The Plot Against the King – featuring a thinly veiled Hillary Clinton as the villain going after “King Donald” while Kash plays a wizard who thwarts her plans.\nHe has been a regular guest on right-wing podcasts and livestream online shows hosted by Bannon, Tim Pool, Benny Johnson and others.\nIn a post on Truth Social network, Trump described Patel as a “brilliant lawyer, investigator, and ‘America First’ fighter”.\nTrump has frequently voiced distrust of the FBI, accusing it of political bias, particularly after its search of his Mar-a-Lago\nresort for classified documents he allegedly stored illegally.\nPatel found common cause with Trump over their shared scepticism of government surveillance and the “deep state” – a pejorative catchall used by Trump to refer to government bureaucracy.\nHe wrote another book – Government Gangsters – which is part memoir and part screed against the so-called deep state.\nPatel’s candidacy has won support from prominent Trump supporters, i",
    "description2": "ncluding people who support the president-elect’s agenda at the FBI and Justice Department and the idea of using his electoral win to pursue retaliation against his perceived adversaries.\nTrump said Patel would restore “fidelity, bravery and integrity” to the agency. Under Patel, Trump said, the FBI would “end the growing crime epidemic in America, dismantle the migrant criminal gangs, and stop the evil scourge of human and drug trafficking across the border”.\nPatel was part of a small group of supporters during Trump’s recent criminal trial in New York who accompanied him to the courthouse, where he told reporters that Trump was the victim of an “unconstitutional circus”.\nHe also testified at a Colorado court hearing related to Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the run-up to the January 6, 2021 riot at the US Capitol.\nPatel, who at the time of the riot was chief of staff to the then-acting defence secretary, testified that Trump had pre-emptively authorised 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers to deploy days before the attack. But a Colorado court later found that Patel was “not a credible witness” on the topic.\nAn October 2024 Atlantic article suggested, Patel “appeared singularly focused on pleasing Trump”.\n“Even in an administration full of loyalists, Patel was exceptional in his devotion.”\nFollowing Trump’s announcement on Saturday, Gerry Connolly, a senior Democratic member of the House of Representatives, called Patel a “zealot”.\n“Out of a sea of unqualified, dangerous, and downright bizarre nominations, this is perhaps the worst,” Connolly said in a post on X.\nPatel has signalled through interviews and public statements a determination to upend the FBI and radically reshape its mission.\nHe has called for dramatically reducing its footprint and limiting its authority, as well as going after government officials who disclose information to reporters.\nIn an interview earlier this year on the Shawn Ryan Show podcast, Patel promised to sever the FBI’s intelligence-gathering activities from the rest of its mission, and said he would “shut down” the bureau’s headquarters building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC, and “reopen it the next day as a museum of the ‘deep state'”.\nIn a separate interview with conservative strategist Steve Bannon, Patel said he and others “will go out and find the conspirators not just in government but in the media”.\nPatel first came to prominence in Trump’s orbit as an outspoken critic of the FBI’s investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.\nAs a staffer on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired at the time by Representative Devin Nunes, a Trump loyalist, Patel helped author a four-page report that detailed what it said were errors the Justice Department made in obtaining a warrant to surveil a former Trump campaign adviser.\nThe document, which came to be colloquially known as the “Nunes memo”, was released over vigorous objections from Wray and Justice Department leaders.\nA subsequent inspector general report identified significant problems with FBI surveillance during the Russia investigation, but it also concluded that the inquiry had been opened for a legitimate purpose and found no evidence that the FBI had acted with partisan motives in conducting the inquiry.\nA 2020 report by the US Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that the Kremlin launched an aggressive effort to meddle in the 2016 presidential contest on behalf of Trump.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "Patel has vowed to downsize the top intelligence body and pursue ‘conspirators’ in the government and media.\nUnited States President-elect Donald Trump has said he plans to tap loyalist Kash Patel to head the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a pick that is expected to disrupt the agency and put Trump’s political adversaries in the crosshairs.\nTrump announced the decision in a post on his Truth Social network on Saturday, saying Patel, who wants to downsize the top intelligence body and pursue “conspirators” in the government and media, would restore “fidelity, bravery and integrity” to the agency.\n“Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and ‘America First’ fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People,” Trump wrote.\nThe announcement means current FBI Director Christopher Wray must either resign or be fired after Trump takes office on January 20.\nAlthough Wray is serving a 10-year term, his removal is not surprising given Trump’s longstanding public criticism of him and the FBI. Wray, who replaced Jim Comey, led the FBI as it investigated Trump for alleged obstruction of justice and raided his Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents, leading to indictments.\nThe decision sets up what is likely to be an explosive confirmation battle in the Senate, which must approve the appointment, not long after Trump’s plan to have another trusted ally, Matt Gaetz, lead the Department of Justice fell through.\nPatel is a lesser-known figure, but his nomination is still expected to cause shockwaves. He has embraced Trump’s rhetoric about a “deep state”, called for a “comprehensive housecleaning” of government workers who are disloyal to Trump and has referred to journalists as traitors, promising to try to prosecute some. He has also pledged he would shut do",

William Barr, Trump’s attorney general, wrote in his memoir that he told then-Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that an appointment to Patel as deputy FBI director would happen “over my dead body”.\n“Patel had virtually no experience that would qualify him to serve at the highest level of the world’s pre-eminent law enforcement agency,” Barr wrote.\nTrump also announced on Saturday that he would nominate Sheriff Chad Chronister, the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County, Florida, to serve as the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). He has worked closely with Trump’s choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi.\n“Chad will work with our great Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to secure the Border, stop the flow of Fentanyl, and other Illegal Drugs, across the Southern Border, and SAVE LIVES,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\nThe FBI is the investigative arm of the Justice Department, while the DEA also falls under its purview.\nThe appointments of Bondi and Patel indicate that Trump is interested in lining up closely aligned appointees willing to carry out his vision and policy inclinations.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:",

    "description1": "\n\n\nKolkata (West Bengal) [India], December 2 (ANI): Business consultant Suhel Seth, on Monday said that US President Joe Biden's unconditional pardon to his son Hunter Biden was a travesty of the US Justice system. He also called out the US justice system on the way they had handled Adani case.\nSeth, in conversation with ANI said that Biden had himself said that the US justice system was infected with politics and questioned if anyone would believe in the system.\n\n\"Yesterday, Joe Biden's unconditional pardon to his son Hunter Biden, to my mind is a travesty of the American justice system. What's worse is that it's an indictment of the justice system itself. A sitting president of the United States, Joe Biden, in this case, in his statement, has said that while he had faith in the American judiciary, he believes that politics has infected the American judiciary and therefore has led to a miscarriage of justice. These are not my words. These are the words of Joe Biden. If a sitting president of America says this about his justice system, you tell me who and where and why should anyone trust this American justice system?\" Seth said.\nSeth told ANI that the US Department of Justice is messed up and had taken a U-turn with Donald Trump.\n\"The Department of Justice is weaponized in the United States. We saw what happened with Donald Trump. Now you tell me, the same judge who indicted Donald Trump has now withdrawn the case. So it is an unholy mess,\" he said.\n\n\nSeth told ANI that he believed that action of US proescutors linking Gautam Adani to an alleged bribery case was because of the success India has achieved recently.\n\"What have we seen with Adanis? They are a group in India. They're operating again, under Indian regulatory systems, which are, to my mind, the best in the world or on par. What do they first say? They issue a press statement. That one particular Adani, another particular Adani have been named. Then they issue a statement. No, their names are not there. It is clearly a politicization and to my mind it's a politicization because of the success that Indians and Indian businesses have achieved. This is a play of po",
    "description2": "litical purpose. It is not a play of justice. It's not a play of equality. You know, Amartya Sen very famously in a book called The Idea of Justice says, and he says it brilliantly, he says ultimately justice is about fairness,\" he said.\nSeth said that if the outgoing US President felt that the justice department was unfair to his son, how could it be fair with Adani, or several Indians indicted in US?\n\"If the American president thinks it's unfair for his son, how can it be fair on any Indian company? Be it Adani, be it anyone. Several Indians individually have been indicted in the United States. See what happened with the famous Goldman Sachs Rajat Gupta case. So I'm telling you that today, people in India who are also the so-called woke, liberal, pseudo-liberal people should realize that the people they had hope in have actually bolted from the stables. The sitting American president on December 1 not only pardons his son, so let's not even talk about nepotism, but issues the worst indictment of the American justice system. Nothing can be more ironic. Nothing can be more telling and nothing can be more disastrous. So the Americans must recognize that they are actually in a banana republic with a kingdom which is falling apart, especially when they believe that justice is one of their important pillars of hope,\" he said.\nUS President Joe Biden on Sunday signed a pardon for his son, Robert Hunter Biden, who had been convicted on charges related to gun crimes and tax violations. The pardon ensures that Hunter Biden will not face sentencing for these offences and removes the possibility of prison time.\nIn a statement, President Biden addressed the charges against his son, arguing that individuals in similar situations--such as those with tax payment issues due to addiction--typically receive non-criminal resolutions. He contended that Hunter's case was treated differently, leading to felony charges despite the absence of aggravating factors.\nBiden also stressed his commitment to not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, despite his belief that his son had been \"selectively and unfairly prosecuted.\" (ANI)\n",

    "description1": "\n\n\nATK\nNew Delhi [India], December 2: The Grammy Awards 2025, which is also the 67th edition of the event, will take place on the 2nd of February 2025 and the nominations were just recently announced on the 8th of November. There are nominations that were expected and did not surprise anyone, but there are also big artists who did not get any nominations and as such, this disappointed them and their fans.\n\nGrammy Awards are intended to evaluate the performance of music talents globally, so it is an international awards show giving praise to artists from all around for what they have brought to the music industry in the past year. Some of the most famous Canadian celebrities couldn't miss this year's nominations either and this is totally deserving based on the work they have done.\nIn this article, we will see which of the Canadian artists made it to the 2025 Grammy Nominations. Additionally, we will briefly cover Canadian emerging artists and talents who also got nominated.\nHow do songs/albums/artists get nominated for Grammys?\nThe Grammy Nominations are given by the Recording Academy. The Recording Academy is a society of music professionals based in the United States. Simply put, this academy has a certain number of members who have the right to vote, and it is through their votes that the nominations happen. To ensure that this judgment is unbiased and solely based on the work of the artist, the members of this academy are chosen carefully, and they all have lengthy expertise in the area.\nWhich Canadian artist made it to the nominations for Grammy 2025?\nThe leading nominee for the Grammy Awards 2025 was Beyonce with 11 nominations in total, which brings the number of nominations of a Grammy to 99 throughout her entire career. However, big names from Canada such as The Weeknd and Kaytranda were also nominated for more than one category.\nKaytranda, or better known as DJ Kaytranda, is a Canadian artist born and raised in Montreal.\nKaytranda has already taken home two Grammys in 2021, one for the category Best Dance/Electronic Album with his album \"BUBBA\" and Best Dance Recording for his single \"10%\". His talent for producing electronic music that is blended with hip-hop, and dance was recognized by the academy and as a result, he was nominated for three top categories as follows:\n* Best Dance/Electronic Album with his latest album titled \"Timeless\"\n* Best Dance/Electronic Recording with his single \"Witchy\"\n* Best Remix Recording with his remix of Doechii's \"Alter Ego\"\nThese are all super importan",
    "description2": "t categories for the genre of music he produces, so the nomination alone is a big achievement for Kaytranda.\n\n\nThe Weeknd on the other hand has already earned 4 Grammys in total while he was nominated 13 times during his career. He won the first and second Grammy for the Best Urban Contemporary Album with his \"Beauty Behind the Madness\" in 2015 and \"Starboy\" in 2018. He also won the Best R&B Performance for the soundtrack \"Earned It\" which was also featured in the movie \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" and Best Melodic Rap Performance with his featuring in \"Hurricane\" by Kanye West.\nFor this upcoming Grammy, The Weeknd was nominated for two of the following categories:\n* Best Melodic Rap Performance for his contribution on \"We Still Don't Trust You\" by Future and Metro Boomin\n* Best Rap Album for the collaborative piece with the same name \"We Still Don't Trust You\"\nOther Canadian music producers who got nominations for Grammy 2025\nApart from DJ Kaytranada and the Weeknd, there are other Canadian artists who also got nominated for the Grammy Awards of 2025. Here is a full list of them:\n* Best Metal Performance for Spiritbox's track \"Cellar Door\"\n* Best Traditional Blues Album for Sue Foley's \"One Guitar Woman\"\n* Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media and Best Opera Recording for the infamous conductor Yannick Nezet-Seguin\n* Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical for Charlotte Day Wilson's \"Cyan Blue\"\nThese are some emerging artists and producers who bring so much talent and potential to the music industry and their nominations are undoubtedly a successful achievement. In case any of them win the Grammy in 2025, then that would simply seal the potential they have for the music industry, but it should be noted that the nominations alone are done by music experts and only being nominated for a Grammy is a huge success.\nA proud moment for Canada\nUltimately, this was a proud moment for Canada. The constant contribution of Canadian artists to the music industry goes to show the country's diverse and well-deserving music scene. Canada's presence at the Grammys has been felt for years now and every year at least a few Canadian celebrities are nominated for the awards.\nIt is already anticipated that the Grammy Awards 2025 will once again be a memorable event for the music industry, and we are sure the Canadian artists alongside the others will shine on this global stage!\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by ATK.

    "description1": "\n\n\nChengdu [SouthwestChina], December 2 (ANI): The East Turkistan Government in Exile (ETGE) has strongly condemned the recent summit between China and the Central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, accusing China of attempting to impose dominance over the region, the ETGE said in a statement.\nThe summit, which marked the Fifth China-Central Asia Foreign Ministers' Meeting, was framed as a diplomatic effort to foster regional cooperation and security, but ETGE claims the agreements signed are part of a broader strategy by China to undermine the sovereignty of Central Asian nations.\n\nIn a statement released on X, ETGE compared China's actions to a warning issued by Bilge Kagan, an 8th-century Turkic leader.\n\n\n\"The Chinese use sweet words, gold, and silk to draw distant nations close, and once they have become close, they seek to destroy them.\" Occupied East Turkistan is the clearest example of this warning. Millions of Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek and other Turkic peoples endure genocide, enslavement, and erasure under Chinese occupation.\"\nThe meeting between China and the five Central Asian nations was a high-level diplomatic event, where foreign ministers gathered to discuss mutual interests, regional cooperation, and broader international issues. The meeting is part of China's ongoing efforts to strengthen ties with Central Asia, a region of strategic importance in its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI",
    "description2": "). However, ETGE and some critics argue that the summit is less about cooperation and more about furthering China's geopolitical ambitions in Central Asia.\nETGE called on the people and leaders of Central Asia to resist what it described as \"Chinese imperialism\" and to safeguard the sovereignty of their nations. The group warned that aligning with China would risk the independence and future of the Central Asian states, drawing parallels to East Turkistan's current struggle. \"Restoring East Turkistan's independence is not just a moral imperative, but the key to eternally safeguarding Central Asia's sovereignty,\" ETGE stated.\nSome observers believe that the summit has raised concerns among countries with stronger ties to Russia or the West, who see China's growing influence in Central Asia as a challenge to their interests in the region. While the meetings are officially aimed at enhancing cooperation, these developments suggest that Central Asia's strategic future may be increasingly shaped by Beijing's influence.\nThe East Turkistan Government in Exile's call to action comes at a time of heightened tension in the region, with several nations in Central Asia balancing their relationships with China, Russia, and Western powers. The ETGE's warning underscores the delicate geopolitical environment in which these countries find themselves, as they navigate pressures from global powers while striving to maintain their independence and sovereignty.

Education is such a medium which is the soul of the family, society and nation.\"\n\"Today, at the beginning of my political innings, I want to share this with you all if I had to choose between politics and education, I would definitely choose education. By joining politics, the development of education is my best objective,\" said Ojha.\n\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Arvind Kejriwal repeated his AAP's stand against having any type of a political tie-up in the capital for the upcoming Delhi assembly polls.\nAt a press conference at AAP headquarters on Sunday, Kejriwal said, \"There will be no alliance in Delhi.\"\n\n\nReacting to AAP contesting Delhi elections alone, BJP leader Kailash Gahlot said, \"I think people of Delhi have decided to bring BJP to power. In the Lok Sabha elections, there was no impact of alliance (between AAP and Congress). People of Delhi are troubled due to damaged roads, overflowing sewers and other issues.\"\n\n\nEarlier this morning, AAP Rajya MP Sanjay Singh filed a Suspension of Business notice in Rajya Sabha under rule 267 on Monday, seeking to discuss the deteriorating law and order situation concerning the 'increasing crimes' in the national capital.\nSanjay Singh, in the motion filed to the Rajya Sabha Secretary General, wrote, \"I would like to draw your attention to the increasing crimes in the country's capital. The Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, ambassadors, and Members of Parliament, from both houses, all reside in Delhi.

We only want you to do your work.\"\nHe also highlighted the threats faced by AAP MLA Naresh Balyan. \"Our MLA Naresh Balyan received threats from a gangster 35-40 times last year. He filed written complaints with the police five times. Our MLA is the victim, yet yesterday he was arrested. What message does this send? That if you receive a threat and complain about it, you will be arrested? This is not the right message. We must be sympathetic toward victims who face such threats. We request Amit Shah to make every effort to establish peace in Delhi,\" the former Chief Minister added.\nNotably, Naresh Balyan was produced before Rouse Avenue Court in Delhi on Sunday and sent to two days' police custody. He was arrested by the Delhi Police's Crime Branch on Saturday in connection with an extortion case.\nLast week, Kejriwal addressed the media, emphasizing that the responsibility for law and order in Delhi rests with the Union government.\nHe also contrasted this with his responsibilities as Chief Minister, saying, \"Ten years ago, I was given the responsibility of schools, electricity, health, and water. I fixed it all. The condition of the water has improved. But the responsibility of security in Delhi is of the Centre. Amit Shah's responsibility is to maintain law and order in Delhi. Amit Shah has failed to fix the law and order in ten years. Delhi is being called the rape capital, the gangster capital. Today, women and businessmen are the most scared.\"\nKejriwal also stated that law and order in Delhi have deteriorated, with gang wars reminiscent of those in Mumbai. \"Nearly 20 people have lost their lives in gang wars on the Yamuna side alone,\" he added.\nIn a separate incident, a man threw liquid at Kejriwal during his padyatra in South Delhi's Malviya Nagar area.

President Biden defended his decision, citing what he viewed as selective prosecution of his son.The president expressed concern about political motivations behind the charges, particularly regarding the gun form case. He maintained that Hunter's treatment differed from typical cases.The pardon sparked varied reactions, including comments from US President-elect Donald Trump's camp. Trump's spokesperson criticised the Democrat-controlled justice system while Trump himself questioned pardons for January 6 defendants.He wrote: 'Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!'Hunter's legal team, led by Abbe Lowell, had previously argued their client was targeted for political reasons. The case revealed challenging family moments, particularly regarding Hunter's substance abuse struggles.The charges could have resulted in significant prison time, with the gun case carrying up to 25 years and the tax case up to 17 years. Hunter, now sober for over five years, had settled his tax obligations with assistance from a wealthy associate.",

    "description1": "The unrest continues in Georgia for the fourth consecutive night, with protesters and police exchanging fireworks and tear gas, respectively. The disturbances, triggered by suspended EU membership talks, have expanded beyond Tbilisi.On Sunday evening, demonstrators gathered on Rustaveli Avenue, equipped with gas masks and displaying Georgian and EU flags, Sky news reported.\"I'm here for a very simple reason, to defend my European future and the democracy of my country,\" said protester Nikoloz Miruashvili.Why the protest started?Georgia, home to 3.7 million inhabitants, has experienced heightened political discord between the governing Georgian Dream party and its critics. The opposition contends that the administration is implementing increasingly autocratic policies whilst moving away from Western alignment and towards Russian interests.The crisis deepened when Prime Minister Kobakhidze announced a three-year delay in EU accession talks, citing EU \"blackmail\". Critics suggest the government is adopting an increasingly authoritarian stance and seeking closer relations with Russia rather than Europe, CNN reported.The European Parliament's resolution criticising the Georgian Dream party and condemning recent elections prompted the talks' suspension. Opposition groups allege Russian interference in the election process, including voter intimidation and ballot manipulation.President Salome Zourabichvili told Sky News: \"They [protesters] saw this election stolen from them and since then, there is no recognition of the legitimacy of the parliament, where no opposition party has entered. It's a one rule parliament, not legitimate, not recognised by our democracy partners.\"Despite constitutional commitment to EU membership and strong public support, protests have spread across Georgia. Interpress reported blockades at Poti's port, while demonstrations occurred in eight locations nationwide. Numerous diplomats and civil servants have contested the legality of suspending EU talks.Prime Minister Kobakhidze has rejected US criticism regarding excessive force against protesters",
    "description2": ". Russian security official Dmitry Medvedev suggested via Telegram that Georgia faces a revolutionary situation, drawing parallels with Ukraine's situation.The tensions recall the 2008 Russian-Georgian conflict over South Ossetia and Abkhazia.'Georgia moving towards dark abyss'Russian authorities are monitoring the situation intently. Former president and security official Dmitry Medvedev commented on Telegram about what he perceived as an attempted revolution, stating \"moving rapidly along the Ukrainian path, into the dark abyss. Usually this sort of thing ends very badly.\"Moscow has not yet issued an official statement regarding Georgia's current situation. However, they have consistently accused Western nations of instigating revolutionary movements in former Soviet territories that Russia continues to consider within its sphere of influence.'Foreign interference unacceptable'Numerous diplomats and civil servants have endorsed open letters contesting the legality of halting EU discussions, noting that EU membership aspirations are constitutionally mandated in Georgia. Kobakhidze acknowledged that several high-ranking diplomats, including the ambassador to Washington, had stepped down.In an official response, Georgia's foreign ministry declared that attempts by foreign nations to \"interfere in the functioning of the institutions of a sovereign state\" were unacceptable.Following the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991, Georgia has predominantly oriented itself towards Western alignment whilst attempting to reduce Russian influence, despite losing a short conflict with Russia in 2008. The nation received assurances of future NATO membership and achieved EU candidate status in the previous year.Western governments and internal opposition groups have expressed growing unease about Georgian Dream's trajectory, despite the party's rebuttals of changing course. The government implemented legislation in June requiring NGOs receiving over 20% foreign funding to register as \"foreign agents\". Additionally, parliament endorsed legislation in September restricting LGBT rights.",

Sanders raised concerns about the Pentagon's budget and recent audit failures.“Elon Musk is right. The Pentagon, with a budget of $886 billion, just failed its 7th audit in a row.

    "description1": "A hitman offered a C$100,000 contract (approximately Rs 6,020,189.11) to kill a crime reporter working at the Montreal newspaper La Presse in Canada. Frédérick Silva, already found guilty of three murders and one attempted murder, admitted to offering the contract to kill journalist Daniel Renaud, as reported by newspaper La Presse. Renaud was covering Silva’s trial in 2021.Silva confessed to the plot after becoming a police informant in 2022, revealing his criminal history to authorities. La Presse learned about the threat against Renaud through Silva’s confession to the police.While in jail during his trial, Silva contacted two organized crime figures about killing Renaud. They reportedly hesitated, calling it a bad idea. The contract remained active for about two months but was never executed. Silva claimed he canceled it due to having “more important issues to deal with.”Quebec Premier François Legault denounced the plot. \\\"It make",

So I never thought that I could have ended up the subject of a contract like this,\\\" he said.Silva is currently serving a life sentence. A former colleague of Renaud and current provincial politician, Vincent Marissal, described Renaud as a “very rigorous person - not the type of guy who makes a lot of noise in the newsroom but apparently he can cause a lot of bother,\" he said. \"That means he's doing his job, but that's certainly no reason to see a price put on his head,\" he added.

    "description1": "Prince Harry has alleged that Prince William was jealous of him before his wedding, for a very surprising reason. The ceremony between Harry and Meghan took place on May 19, 2018, at Windsor Castle's St George's Chapel. Despite serving as his brother's supporter on the day, Harry revealed they experienced significant discord beforehand, UK Mirror reported.Whilst both brothers donned military attire for their respective weddings, Harry received authorisation to maintain his beard, a privilege previously denied to William. Military protocol typically requires personnel to be clean-shaven whilst wearing the Blues and Royals frock coat uniform. However, Harry obtained special dispensation from the Queen to retain his facial hair, which reportedly angered his brother.In his autobiography 'Spare', Harry detailed the 'beard-gate' situation: \"And yet I now dared to make another ask – Granny, please, may I, for my wedding, keep my beard? Not a small ask either. A beard was thought by some to be a clear violation of protocol and long-standing norms, especially since I was getting married in my Army uniform. Beards were forbidden in the British Army.\" Upon learning of t",
    "description2": "he Queen's approval, Harry stated William \"became livid\" and declared: \"You put her in an uncomfortable position, Harold! She had no choice but to say yes.\"The disagreement persisted for over a week, with William allegedly demanding Harry shave. Harry recounted his response: \"For the love of God, Willy, why does this matter so much to you? 'Because I wasn't allowed to keep my beard.' Ah, there it was. After he'd come back from an assignment with Special Forces, Willy was sporting a full beard, and someone told him to be a good boy, run along and shave it. He hated the idea of me enjoying a perk he'd been denied.\"In March 2024, the British Army revised its regulations, permitting servicemen to grow well-maintained beards. Prince William has since grown his own beard, which has received positive public reception, although his daughter Princess Charlotte initially disapproved.During a November visit to Cape Town, William discussed his facial hair: \"Charlotte didn't like it the first time. I got floods of tears the first time I grew a beard, so I had to shave it off. And then I grew it back. I thought, hang on a second and I convinced her it was going to be okay.\"",

    "description1": "In a move that has surprised many, US President Joe Biden has issued a sweeping pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, reversing his earlier promise not to intervene in his son's legal troubles. The pardon, announced on Sunday, covers Hunter Biden’s convictions for gun and tax offences, as well as any other federal offences committed or potentially committed between 1 January 2014 and 1 December 2024. The decision marks a significant shift for Biden, who had previously vowed to restore respect for the rule of law and pledged he would not pardon his son. “No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son — and that is wrong,” the president said in a statement, as reported by Associated Press (AP). What is a presidential pardon? Under the US Constitution, the president has the power to grant clemency, which can include pardons and commutations. A pardon forgives federal crimes entirely, while a commutation reduces penalties without erasing the conviction. The power, derived from English law, is broad, allowing presidents to address various offences. However, it is limited to federal crimes and does not cover state offences or impeachment convictions. Presidents frequently use this power. Barack Obama granted clemency 1,927 times during his two terms, while Donald Trump issued 237 acts of clemency during his presidency. Hunter Biden’s convictions In June, Hunter Biden was convicted of lying on a federal gun purchase form in 2018 by falsely claiming he was not using drugs. He later pleaded guilty to failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes, despite living extravagantly, spending money on luxury hotels and other indulgences. Both cases stemmed from a period in Hunter Biden’s life when he struggled with drug addiction. Now sober for over five years, he had initially agree",
    "description2": "d to a plea deal to avoid further trials, aiming to spare his family embarrassment. However, that deal fell apart, and he was subsequently indicted. Hunter Biden was due to be sentenced in December, facing potential prison terms of up to 25 years for the gun charges and 17 years for tax offences. Federal guidelines, however, suggested he might have avoided incarceration altogether. Why did Biden change his mind? Earlier this year, Biden insisted he would not pardon his son, expressing pride in Hunter for overcoming addiction. As recently as November, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated this stance. In his Sunday statement, Biden explained that Hunter had been “selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted.” The president suggested that political adversaries had unduly influenced the process. \"There has been an effort to break Hunter — who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution,\" Biden said. \"In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me. Enough is enough.\" Biden, no longer running for re-election, appeared less constrained by political optics. He also highlighted discrepancies in how similar cases are handled for other defendants, calling the treatment of Hunter Biden unjust. Presidential pardons for family and allies Biden is not the first president to use pardoning powers for those close to him. Donald Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and multiple allies involved in the Russia investigation. Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother Roger Clinton for drug charges and his former business partner Susan McDougal for her role in the Whitewater controversy. The move has reignited debates about the ethical boundaries of presidential pardon powers and whether Biden’s decision aligns with his pledge to uphold the rule of law. (With inputs from AP)",

Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung in a statement said “The failed witch hunts against President Trump have proven that the Democrat-controlled DOJ and other radical prosecutors are guilty of weaponizing the justice system.” Cheung further added, “That system of justice must be fixed and due process must be restored for all Americans, which is exactly what President Trump will do as he returns to the White House with an overwhelming mandate from the American people,” as reported by NBC News.

    "description1": "Tensions continue to escalate in Georgia as widespread protests against the government’s decision to freeze European Union membership talks for four years enter their fourth consecutive night. Demonstrations, initially concentrated in the capital Tbilisi, have now spread to other parts of the country, underscoring growing opposition to the ruling Georgian Dream party's policies. Police clashed with thousands of protesters on Tbilisi's central Rustaveli Avenue on Sunday, deploying water cannons and tear gas. Protesters retaliated with fireworks, prompting authorities to push demonstrators away from the parliament building into nearby streets. \"It’s exhausting to see our government ignoring the will of its people,\" said protester Nikoloz Miruashvili. \"We are fighting for our European future and democracy,\" reported Reuters. The unrest follows a contentious decision by the Georgian government to delay EU membership talks, sparking accusations of authoritarianism and a pivot towards Russia. Protests have spread beyond Tbilisi, with reports of road blockades near the port city of Poti and demonstrations in at least eight other towns. In Khashuri, protesters reportedly pelted a Georgian Dream office with eggs, according to opposition media. The EU and US have expressed deep concern over Georgia’s perceived shift away from its pro-Western aspirations. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the developments as \"alarming,\" while Washington criticised the use of \"excessive force\" against demonstrators. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze dismissed US ",
    "description2": "criticism, calling it a \"temporary setback,\" and said the situation would be addressed with the incoming US administration. President Salome Zourabichvili, a vocal proponent of EU integration, has denounced the recent parliamentary elections as illegitimate and has called for pressure on the Constitutional Court to annul the results. Despite her term nearing its end, Zourabichvili stated she would not step down until a legitimate government is in place. Russia, meanwhile, has closely monitored the unfolding events. Dmitry Medvedev, former Russian president, claimed Georgia was headed down a dangerous path akin to Ukraine, warning of dire consequences. The Kremlin has yet to issue an official statement but frequently accuses Western powers of instigating unrest in post-Soviet states. The protests come against a backdrop of legislative changes seen as curtailing freedoms. In June, Georgian Dream introduced a \"foreign agents\" law requiring NGOs receiving significant foreign funding to register as such. Parliament also passed a controversial law restricting LGBT rights. The government insists these measures are necessary to safeguard national sovereignty and prevent conflict with Russia. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, on her first day in office, expressed solidarity with the demonstrators, affirming their right to choose a \"European future.\" As unrest continues to grow, opposition groups have urged employers to grant paid leave for participation in protests, amplifying calls for a united stand against the government’s controversial policies.

In a strike on a hospital in Aleppo, close to 12 people died while another strike inside the north-western city of Idlib killed at least eight civilians and more than 50 were wounded, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The offensive by the rebel forces have also led to the capture of a strategic military base located east of Aleppo and large areas of both Aleppo and Idlib provinces. The sudden attack by the opposition forces has met with less resistance from the regime personnel. Moreover, it has also come at a time when Syria’s biggest backers, Iran and Russia, have remained engaged in their own conflicts wherein Iran with Israel and Russia with Ukraine.

In his first address against the rebel attacks, President Assad vowed the regime will defeat \"terrorists and their supporters\" As per the Sky News which quoted Syrian Observatory, at least 327 people, including 44 civilians, have been killed since the offensive began in Syria between rebel forces and regime personnel.",

    "description1": "Protests in Georgia's capital entered third consecutive night following the government’s decision to halt negotiations to join the European Union. Officials confirmed that 44 people were hospitalised after the police used water cannons and tear gas on the demonstrators. On Saturday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered outside parliament, throwing stones and setting off fireworks. An effigy of Bidzina Ivanishvili, the billionaire founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party with extensive business ties to Russia, was burned in front of the legislature. Beyond the capital, the Georgian news agency Interpress said demonstrators had blocked an access road into the country’s main commercial port in the Black Sea city of Poti. The Interior Ministry reported that among those hospitalised were 27 protesters, 16 police officers, and one media worker. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze warned that any legal violations would face severe consequences. “Politicians hiding in their offices and sacrificing their violent groups will not escape accountability,” he said during a Sunday briefing. Kobakhidze rejected claims that Georgia had abandoned its European integration ambitions, stating, “We have only rejected the shameful blackmail, which was a significant obstacle to our integration.” On Saturday, he accused unspecified “foreign entities” of seeking to impose a “Maidan-style scenario” on Georgia, referring to Ukraine's 2014 revolution that overthrew a pro-Moscow government. The prime minister also dismissed a statement by the US State Department announcing the suspension of its strategic partnership with Georgia and criticising the country’s decision to halt its EU accession e",
    "description2": "fforts. Kobakhidze suggested this move was aimed at leaving difficulties for the incoming US administration, adding, “We will wait for the new administration to discuss matters.” The Georgian Dream party's disputed victory in the 26 October parliamentary election has fuelled major demonstrations and an opposition boycott of parliament. The opposition alleges the vote was rigged with Russian involvement to keep Georgia aligned with Moscow’s interests. Georgia’s pro-Western President, Salome Zourabichvili, described the country as becoming a “quasi-Russian” state, accusing Georgian Dream of controlling major institutions. “We are not calling for a revolution but demanding new elections under conditions that ensure the will of the people is respected,” she told the Associated Press. The government’s suspension of EU negotiations came after the European Parliament condemned last month’s election as neither free nor fair, citing democratic backsliding under Georgian Dream’s leadership. The EU, which granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023, withheld financial support earlier this year over the passage of a controversial “foreign influence” law. EU lawmakers have called for a rerun of the election within a year under international oversight, and sanctions against Georgian officials. Kobakhidze responded by accusing the European Parliament of using “insults and blackmail” against Georgia and announced that the country would refuse EU budgetary grants until 2028. Critics argue that Georgian Dream is steering the country towards authoritarianism and closer ties with Moscow, citing recent laws targeting freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.

    "description1": "Welcome to this week’s roundup of key global events and developments shaping politics, economics, and society. From groundbreaking policy shifts and diplomatic manoeuvres to emerging stories of resilience and upheaval, we bring you the latest updates and insights. For Indian audiences, understanding these developments is not just about keeping informed—it’s about identifying the ripple effects that could influence India’s foreign policy and its position in an increasingly fragmented world. Whether it’s a headline-grabbing the world’s attention or an underreported issue with far-reaching consequences, we aim to provide a clear, concise, and comprehensive overview of what matters most. Escalating tensions in Ukraine Tensions in Ukraine continue to mount as Russian President Vladimir Putin escalates his rhetoric and military actions. In a chilling warning, Putin announced that Russia could use its new hypersonic ballistic missile, the Oreshnik, to “turn targets in Kyiv to dust”. This threat was framed as a direct response to Ukraine’s deployment of Western long-range missiles to strike within Russia. “At present, the ministry of defence and the general staff are selecting targets to hit on Ukrainian territory. These could be military facilities, defence and industrial enterprises, or decision-making centres in Kyiv,” Putin declared during a meeting in Kazakhstan. His words signal an intensifying strategy against Ukraine’s infrastructure and leadership hubs, which are concentrated in Kyiv’s heavily fortified government quarter. Ukraine has already felt the brunt of this escalation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported that “about 100 attack drones, more than 90 missiles of various types” had targeted critical energy facilities, plunging parts of the country into blackouts. Particularly concerning is the alleged use of cluster munitions, weapons known for their devastating effects on civilian populations. Despite these challenges, Ukraine’s air defence systems have demonstrated remarkable resilience, intercepting 90 per cent of incoming missiles. However, 12 missiles evaded interception, underscoring the increasing sophistication of Russian tactics. Russia has reportedly employed thermal and radar traps, electronic jammers on missiles, and taken advantage of adverse weather conditions, including fog and clouds, to challenge Ukraine’s air defence. The heightened military activity has also forced Ukraine to close its Parliament due to the missile threats. The building, located in Kyiv’s government district, stands alongside key institutions such as the presidential administration and the national bank, making it a likely target in any intensified offensive. This latest round of threats and strikes underscores the deepening crisis in Ukraine, with devastating consequences for both its civilian population and critical infrastructure. France ignores International Criminal Court France has stirred controversy by signalling that it may not detain Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu despite an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Gaza. The French foreign ministry cited Netanyahu’s potential immunity, arguing that Israel’s non-signatory status to the Rome Statute, the treaty establishing the ICC, grants him protection. “A state cannot be compelled to act in a manner incompatible with its obligations under international law regarding the immunities of states not party to the ICC,” the ministry stated. “Such immunities apply to Prime Minister Netanyahu and other concerned ministers and must be taken into account if the ICC were to request their arrest and surrender.” The stance has sparked sharp criticism from human rights organisations like Amnesty International, which called it “deeply problematic” and contrary to France’s obligations as an ICC member. The ICC issued arrest warrants last week for Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, accusing them of “crimes against humanity and war crimes” during Israel’s Gaza offensive. The ICC’s authority, however, remains limited. While its 124 member states are obligated to arrest suspects on their soil, the court lacks enforcement mechanisms, leaving the warrants largely symbolic if states like France choose non-cooperation. This development comes as Paris played a pivotal role alongside the US in brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Yet, critics argue that France’s position undermines the ICC and appears motivated by political pragmatism. Emmanuel Macron’s administration has faced accusations of prioritising Israel’s support for the ceasefire over justice for alleged war crimes. The strained relations between Macron and Netanyahu add another layer of complexity. French officials have been vocal in their criticism of Israel’s military actions in Gaza and Lebanon, while simultaneously working to contain the conflicts. This balancing act has led to growing scepticism, both domestically and internationally, about France’s commitment to international law. As the debate continues, France’s approach risks setting a precedent for other nations grappling with ICC arrest warrants, potentially weakening the court’s ability to hold leaders accountable for alleged atrocities. Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire A ceasefire agreement brokered by the United States and France between Israel and Hezbollah aims to “promote conditions for a permanent and comprehensive situation,” according to its terms. US President Joe Biden described the deal as an effort to deliver a “permanent cessation of hostilities”. The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah had escalated dramatically in recent months. Israel launched a series of bold military operations, including covert tactics and a ground invasion—the first in nearly two decades. The campaign inflicted significant damage on Hezbollah, with most of its leadership, including Hassan Nasrallah, killed, and large portions of its arsenal destroyed. Tamir Hayman, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, described the military success as “exceptional,” emphasising the systematic destruction of Hezbollah’s positions in southern Lebanon. Despite these achievements, the war came at a heavy cost. Over 3,700 people were killed in Lebanon, with more than 1 million displaced, while Israel lost 140 civilians and soldiers and saw 60,",
    "description2": "000 people displaced from the north. Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser, acknowledged the toll on Israel’s resources and the strain on its reservists, noting, “Israel cannot afford another year of war at its current scale.” The ceasefire, rooted in an updated version of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, lays out 13 points of agreement aimed at reducing the potential for future hostilities. Key provisions include: Demilitarisation south of the Litani River: Only Lebanese military and security forces are permitted to operate south of the river, with checkpoints established to monitor the area. Weapons oversight: Lebanon’s government must regulate arms sales and prevent Hezbollah from rearming. Israeli withdrawal: Israeli forces will retreat south of the de facto border within two months as the Lebanese army reclaims positions south of the Litani River. The deal faces immediate challenges. Both sides have alleged violations. Lebanese authorities reported Israeli mortar attacks injuring civilians, while Israel accused Hezbollah of attempting to restock its arsenal. “Hezbollah will be in violation of the agreement not only if it fires on us, but if it obtains weapons to fire at us in the future,” said Netanyahu, warning of a forceful response to any breach. Strategically, the ceasefire allows Israel to redirect its focus to Hamas in Gaza. Netanyahu has promised to escalate operations against Hamas, describing it as part of Israel’s “sacred mission” to secure the release of hostages. The agreement also hinges on Lebanon’s fragile political landscape. The country’s parliamentary speaker, Nabih Berri, announced a vote to elect a new president in an effort to resolve a two-year power vacuum. However, the weakened state of Lebanon’s institutions may hinder the deal’s implementation. As the situation unfolds, the ceasefire represents a tenuous but crucial step toward stabilising one of the region’s most volatile fronts. Syrian rebels advance For the first time in four years, Syrian rebels have launched a significant offensive against the Assad regime and its backers, Russia and Iran. The militants, led by the extremist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), have advanced eastward from Idlib, the last major opposition-held region, capturing approximately 100 sq km, according to HTS sources. The Syrian government described the attack as “a huge and large-scale terrorist attack” involving heavy weaponry. HTS, designated a terrorist organisation by the US, has ruled northwestern Syria since Assad reclaimed most of the country with support from Iran and Russia. The offensive marks a shift in Syria’s power dynamics, heavily influenced by the broader Middle East conflict. Assad, though still in power, presides over a fractured nation facing renewed challenges. Dareen Khalifa, a Syria expert at Crisis Group, told the Financial Times that for the rebels, “this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. When else are you going to ever get the world, the US, Israel, and everyone else going after their rivals?” The rebels have benefited from two key factors: Regional instability: The escalation comes in the wake of an Israeli-Hezbollah ceasefire, which freed up Hezbollah’s forces previously engaged in southern Lebanon. Israel has also intensified its strikes on Iranian-linked targets in Syria, including weapons depots and militants. Just last week, an Israeli attack in Palmyra reportedly killed dozens of fighters. Shifting alliances: Despite signs of rapprochement between Turkey and Syria, Turkey continues to support rebels in northern Syria, complicating Assad’s position. For Israel, the offensive underscores its long-standing fears of Iranian-backed factions using Syria as a base for attacks. In response, Israel has fortified its defences in the Golan Heights and continues to target border crossings and militant positions. Although the rebels’ offensive represents a challenge to Assad, their long-term success is uncertain. Protests in Pakistan Thousands of supporters of former prime minister Imran Khan defied police barricades, tear gas, and rubber bullets to stage mass protests in Islamabad demanding his release and the dissolution of the government. The demonstrations, which began on last Sunday, are the largest in Pakistan since the February elections, which Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party alleges were rigged against them. One police officer was killed and dozens were injured in clashes. PTI-aligned doctors accused law enforcement of using live ammunition, claiming one protester was shot near Islamabad. Authorities have denied these allegations but vowed to bring “violent protesters to justice”, according to a statement from the interior ministry. Imran Khan, who has been acquitted or granted bail in five cases, faces over 100 criminal charges ranging from corruption to terrorism. He has denied all allegations, describing them as politically motivated. PTI members claim Khan’s imprisonment is part of a broader crackdown, with hundreds of party members arrested since May 2023 following riots targeting military installations. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s military-backed administration has taken a hardline stance, sealing Islamabad with shipping containers, deploying riot police, and closing roads to prevent protesters from reaching the capital. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi instructed police to arrest anyone attempting to breach the barricades. Despite the government’s efforts, large crowds gathered in defiance of a court ruling declaring PTI protests unlawful and a ban on public gatherings of five or more people. Protesters, galvanised by Khan’s populist rhetoric and allegations of election rigging, demanded the release of political prisoners and the restoration of what they call their “stolen mandate.” The protests highlight the political and economic instability gripping Pakistan. With the government struggling to navigate a legitimacy crisis and one of Asia’s most fragile economies, the demonstrations pose a serious challenge to Sharif’s administration. The unrest underscores Pakistan’s deepening political divides and the fraught relationship between civilian governments and the military, which has long played a dominant role in the nation’s politics. As the crisis continues, it remains unclear how the government will respond to the growing demands for change.",
