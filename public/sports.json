    "description1": "Benafsha Hashimi is sitting on her father’s lap, stroking his beard, in Kabul, Afghanistan when an advisory message plays out on the television. “Don't come to Australia illegally on boats”, a note for the many immigrant residents risking, often losing, their lives to get across. Little Benafsha thinks Australia is just on the other side of the big river in Kabul. “I shall go there, pedar (Father, in Dari language) one day, I have to just cross the river”. The father tells her she has to learn swimming first. “Don’t worry, I can go in a boat!” The father laughs but assures her that she can go the proper way one day but she has to study hard and grow up. Nearly one-and-half decades later, in 2021, the 21 year old Hashimi has ended up in Canberra in Australia, escaping the clutches of Taliban, surviving the death of her father, an Afghan special forces soldier, in mysterious circumstances. But she also witnessed an aunt who bled to death, besides myriad shootings, before dragging her entire Afghan team of women along with her. All this when she was still a teenager, three years back. It’s a remarkable story of hope, will-power, selflessness, stubbornness, and a lot of cheekiness. We meet at an outdoorsy cafe the morning after India’s warm-up game against the Prime Minister’s XI. Almost immediately, she excuses herself and hops off to play with a dog that was barking rather loudly and she laughs, a lovely full-throated aural memory that will stick in the mind, when the dog’s owner says ‘he likes his own voice’. When she plonks back on her chair, she announces, “I have a cat, Lilly. I love lilies and my Lilly. We talk a lot.” It’s probably the rare imagery of the morning when she reflects her age; the rest of the time, as she narrates her life story, immense inspiring maturity floats in the air. It’s a story that’s difficult to decide where to start. At that moment, perhaps, when the Taliban had taken over the city, the 18-year old rushes to the bank to withdraw money for her family of 10 but instead hears the Taliban soldiers outside the bank, firing in the air. Or at the Checkpost at Pakistan border, when she is fleeing with the family in the middle of night 'sadly like a pack of thieves” and is stopped by the Talibs, who bark at her brother Hamid to tell “this girl to stop talking, who has given a girl rights to talk, just stand aside.” Or the moment when her phone starts to ring, with a popular Farsi love song triggering outrage in the Taliban soldiers, and her brother muttering, ‘we are all going to die’ even as he tried to stop the call. It was her friend, a cricketing team-mate wanting to know her whereabouts. It’s perhaps best to start with why that friend was reaching out. Not at that moment, but how Benafsha became the rallying group leader for the girls of her cricket team, and their families, to get to Australia in a move that’s bound to have positive repercussions for generations to come for those families. “No, no, it was a combined team effort, I couldn’t have done it without my friends,” she says but it’s clear that they couldn’t have even dared to dream this life without her. She was the resourceful one, tirelessly pursuing opportunities outside, sending emails to all parts of the cricketing world and beyond to see a possible light at the end of the Taliban tunnel. The first three emails were her passport to survival and better life but unbelievably she chose to ignore them. The US authorities offered her escape due to her father’s past with them, Canada threw her a lifeline and so did Dubai, but she is adamant that she wants her team with her. “My well-wishers who were trying to help me to escape all understandably called me an idiot. But I was stubborn. In weak moments when I would think perhaps I should take it, an inner voice would come loud and clear: ‘C’mon Benafsha, you are a team player. This is not what a good person does. You can’t abandon your friends and be selfish.” And so she even lies to her mother that she didn’t hear back from anyone. That they have to just wait and hope. It’s when Mel Jones, an Australian woman cricketer of stature hears her story, and offers help. The Australian authorities get into the picture soon and are shocked to hear that she wants the entire team and families to escape. “You know, right, we can’t do that. It’s not easy, how can we take so many people out. You and your family come first.” Benafasha Hashimi listens to no one but her inner voice. “Even today when I speak to youngsters I tell them, my life motto is, “Listen to all, but don’t follow anyone. Only follow your heart, courage will come automatically.” Around us, the dog is now barking at a distance as the owners have just left, the sun is shining brightly, and the cafe lady offers coffee; Benafsha doesn’t want any. “That dog is funny. I haven’t heard any other dog in this city bark as loudly as him. It’s not like Kabul, you know,” she says. Or India. But we plunge back to Kabul, before we can return to her escape, and to her father. “He treated me like a little princess. Usually Afghan men prefer sons; he was different, distributing laddoos to everyone in the neighbourhood when I was born, his fourth child. He would keep telling me that I am a special one and can do whatever I want, live my dream but only that I have to be educated and work hard.” Due to the nature of his work, he was often away. “And then one day, he came in a coffin. There he was laid out, outside our door and I was not even 10 then. I just sat there, staring at him. My younger sister kept repeating, “he is just sleeping, he will wake up.” It was their mother who took both aside to tell them that their father is no more and it’s okay to cry. “Don’t bottle it up, cry if you have to. This is what it is. We have to face reality.” The reality kept turning dark. “Some said he had a heart-attack, some said he was poisoned, we don’t know to this day.” Not long after that, more tragedy struck. Benafsha found herself pouring water on her aunt’s dea",
    "description2": "d body to cleanse. “Only women are allowed in our tradition. She was shot in the hip and head, blood on her body when she was brought home.” A childhood shot to pieces, pushing her to grow up rather too quickly but luckily one remnant would remain. “Cricket saved my life,” she says with a chirpiness, and adding solemnly, “Cricket is my life.” *** Her mother never liked her playing cricket. Especially in the streets with the boys, once she grew up a little. The coaches at the official academy didn’t take a liking to her because she was a “street cricketer” and not someone who grew up in the system. Her memories of playing in the streets still remain very special to her. “The empty oil tin cans were our stumps and I must say I terrorised the boys by hitting!” It was her eldest brother Hamid who kept fighting with their mother to allow her to play cricket and things turned a bit when she won a scholarship to a cricket talent programme. Things kept escalating positively and she was named alongside 25 girls, officially contracted by the Afghanistan Cricket board in 2021. The lights would go out soon, though. She remembers that day at the bank just days after the Taliban took over. “When I heard the shootings I froze in fear. I huddled behind other women, not knowing what would happen.” But it wasn’t the bullets that was her worst moment, but the vulgar gaze of a male Taliban soldier. “He gave me this look - a dirty look that I can’t describe but I knew what it was. He told the others to stop shooting and told me that the bank is shut today, but write your name now in this paper. And come to meet me tomorrow. I shall take you inside. I nodded and ran from there, shivering. That look is my worst memory from those days at Kabul. It made me doubly determined that I should leave Afghanistan. There was no option left.” But as we know even when the opportunities came, she didn’t take them as she wanted her team also to be safe. “I am the one doing all the paperwork, emailing, talking in my broken English; what would happen to them if I left?” And so she pressed the Australian authorities to somehow pull off the miracle for her. They buckled under her sweet emotional pressure, and promised her they would. That they will process the paperwork, get the required permission, but the evacuation can’t be en-masse. First her and her family. “I managed to get two more families along with me, of course,” she smiles. And it’s to that night in September 2021 she returns to. “Many in our group were happy, but me and my sister Safia, who is two years younger and also in our team, were sad. We love Afghanistan, we loved our days in Kabul. We didn’t want to leave …” There were numerous checkpoints, where they would all insist that they were off to a wedding. It was at one such post where her phone rang with Farsi love tune drifting in the air. “The talibs were so angry, screaming that it’s blasphemy and that we shall be whiplashed. Somehow we got through.” They were in Pakistan, first, for a week before they flew to Australia. They say it takes a village to rear a child, it takes people from different countries to flee that village in distress. Walwala and Toba in Afghanistan cricketing circuit, unnamed Australian authorities, Mel Jones, and Catherine Ordway, a lawyer, academic, and sports integrity expert who has been part of tribunals. Catherine, who had helped her through the process, was at hand to receive her in Australia, and very soon would be referred to as “mum” by Benafsha. “ I remember the moment when we emotionally bonded. They had taken us, not long after arrival in Canberra, to the river. It was a man-made waterbody and was black in colour. I have never seen black waters before and even as I was talking to her, I held her hand. My friends whispered to me not to do it, and so I asked her if she minded. She had this bright smile when she said no, and gave me this hug. I call her mum, these days.” She plays for two clubs in Australia, she also played for Sydney University team briefly, and travelled to Fiji to play cricket with the organisation ‘Cricket without Borders’. In January, she will represent Afghan Women XI that will play against Cricket without Borders at MCG in Melbourne. “We shall get there early January and there will be selection trials. I would absolutely love it if I were the captain!” Not everything is hunky dory. The past has a way to cling on, leaving its residues in the soul. Benafsha often wakes up screaming at nights, calling out for her mother. “I would have different nightmares that also include me being about to be killed.” Seeing the alarmed face, she explains in a gentle voice as if speaking to a kid. “Don’t worry, it’s normal. In the most depressive times when one is in a place of great trouble, as I was in Kabul, nothing spills out. Your determination, your need to be positive and look ahead gets you through. Often, when you reach a safe place, with the troubles seemingly behind you, it’s when the trauma hits.” She is taking counselling and is all set to pursue her sports management course, that has psychology in the syllabus, at the Canberra University from February next year. She then cues up an awww moment with her own mother, who had worried about her playing cricket, worried about her straying outside on the streets, worried about her studying in Kabul - again her brother had insisted she must as it was the father’s dream and she was the brightest kid in the family. “One day here, she said, “Benafsha, without you, none of this would have been possible. I dread to think what would have happened to us in Kabul.” There is this look on Benafsha’s face as she recalls that - not a face of pride, surprisingly, but of love. And as he gets up to leave, ignoring protests that she has not even eaten anything and whether she needs a lift, Benafsha, which means 'violet' and whose nickname is 'Choti Shaitaan (Little Devil), beams this bright smile and says, “Don’t worry Janaab, I know my way, this is my country now!”",

    "description1": "Rohit Sharma didn’t open, choosing to bat at No.4 in the Prime Minister’s XI pink-ball game at Manuka Oval, triggering obvious thoughts about his batting position in the Adelaide Test. It does make sense after KL Rahul’s assured batting as an opener in both innings of the Perth Test, the way he mentored Yashasvi Jaiswal in the second dig there. It was Shubman Gill, who batted at three, reassuming his position that he has made his own, and made a neat fifty. It also allows Rohit, who has been a bit too impetuous in the recent Tests as an opener, to settle in a middle-order role. He lasted just 11 balls though against PM XI, chasing a ball well outside off from Charlie Anderson, and edging it to the slips. The crowd sensed that Virat Kohli was not at the ground - he had left by then—and a large section left the arena. Rishabh Pant, who kept for the first half of the PM XI’s batting innings before Sarfaraz Khan took over, too didn’t bat. Rohit’s batting position has been a topic of debate ever since Rahul batted as well as he did in the first Test. Perhaps, it would have been different had Rohit been in a richer vein of form. At his pomp as Test opener, he was the classic opener, not taking any risks, letting a ton of balls go through to the ‘keeper, taking his time to open up. But of late, he has been in a bit of a hurry, trying to stamp his authority rather quickly on the proceedings. The middle-order role allows him more breathing space, and less issues as he doesn’t have to face the moving pink ball. All else went pretty well for India. They won the toss and chose to bowl first to test their batting under lights. The pink ball did move around a bit, especially when new, in total contrast to the afternoon when it was pretty flat. The game itself was a bit of a friendly as India kept batting on even after they “won”, chasing down the 241-run target. Mid-afternoon rains had reduced the game from 50-overs to 46 and Sam Konstas-the 19-year old opener who has suddenly shot up in the national reckoning and was in the frame to be selected for the Perth Test-slammed an aggressive hundred. Yashasvi Jaiswal took it up to Jack Nisbet in Canberra but the fiery NSW quick wasn't backing down! 👀 #PMXIvIND pic.twitter.com/tX3O86wEv2 — cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) December 1, 2024 Compact Rahul Rahul continued to showcase his compact technique.

    "description2": "ccasionally let his hands jar at the ball, dragging the bat away from the body. But in Perth, as also here, he just played the line. If the ball jagged away, it would sail past the edge without any danger. Even the forward stride that was so precise and effective at Perth was on view here. His form gives additional reason for Rohit to go down the order. Gill eased into his knock without much fuss. There were a couple of deliveries initially when he had a bit of a poke and a miss, and Rahul came across for a mid-pitch chat. The ball had straightened or just about shaped away on those occasions. There weren't many alarms for him afterwards, and pretty soon in his piece, he unfurled his short-arm jabbed cut - that stroke without much follow-through and a shot that was reared on cement tracks in childhood. It’s quite a visual treat, as he allows the ball to come through and sort of hammers the nail on its head with one swift fluid move. A half-century for Shubman Gill in his first innings of India's Australian tour #PMXIvIND pic.twitter.com/YCPGFMqvs8 — cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) December 1, 2024 Jaiswal was squared-up a couple of times against the new ball cutting away from him. There were a couple more edged fours through slips as he tried to charge and heave once, and got a leading edge on the other when he tried to work the ball to the on side. But when he wanted to be compact and tight, he was. The only real sign of concern, if that word can be used, when he seemingly had a back spasm. He kept fiddling with his back and when it ailed him a tad bit more, he took treatment from the physio, as he lay on his stomach. But it must not have been something serious as he continued batting. Of all the Indian batsmen, he was the one who tried to be overtly aggressive, and eventually miscued a heave to cover. Nitish Reddy continued to be his impressively busy self. Just as he did to Nathan Lyon at Perth, he took the attack to the leg spinner Lloyd Pope. A charge down the track and a slog sweep had the crowd howling in delight but the shot of the game was his revere-swept boundary. It was some shot, to a full delivery outside off and Reddy just let his hands go through the shot in some style. India wrapped up the game, with most batsmen they wanted getting a hit, and the bowlers getting a bowl. Brief Scores: Prime Minister's XI 240 (Konstas 107, Jacobs 61, Rana 4-44) lost to India 257 for 5 (Gill 50, Jaiswal 45, Reddy 42, Washington 42*, Anderson 2-30) by five wickets.",

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/Arsneal-football.jpg",
    "description1": "Two events foreshadow an Arsenal corner kick. The moment the referee decrees one, Gabriel, the strapping centre-back, ambles to the vicinity of the far post. On the touchline, manager Mikel Arteta, perennially on an emotional edge, slouches onto his seat in the dug-out; set-piece coach Nicolas Jover, with a twinkle in his eyes, veers onto the touchline. Two events often follow an Arsenal corner kick too. The soaring giant of a man, Gabriel leaping above his markers, sliding and stretching his neck as though it were made of rubber and heading the ball into the net. Jover would leap and swipe the air. Since the start of last season, Arsenal have converted more set-pieces than any other club (25 excluding penalties) in the Premier League. Gabriel, unsurprisingly, has netted more goals than any other centre-back since his arrival in the 2021-22 season (15, the next best Virgil van Dijk has scored nine times). It’s so frequent that their supporters buzz as though they have earned a penalty. The action — from the time the ball goes out and the corner is swung — barely takes half a minute. In this time, the players move to their designated positions, which vary from match to match. But the most common pattern features one of Arsenal’s players rubbing shoulders with the goalkeeper inside the six-yard box, giving a false impression that he is the intended target. He is rather the decoy, his only intention being to distract the goalkeeper, manufacturing space for the intended target (often Gabriel, but not always him, as it could become too predictable). Gabriel lurks on the edge of the six-yard box, on the left. Three of them usually hover behind him, inside the 18-yard box. They are the dummy runners, trying to clear out the far post area. When the ball swings in, they often move towards the ball, dragging markers to the near post. One or two might linger just outside the box and the rest stand behind them, to thwart any counter-attack. So far, it’s straightforward. The deliveries, Bukayo Saka from the right and Declan Rice from the left, are largely in-swingers fired either on the goalkeeper or to the back post. Some bend late into the goal; some don’t. It's then the intricate patterns set in a fury of limbs moving this way or that. The runners from deep in the box charge in, the shield dishevels the goalkeeper or the nearest defender (sometimes controversially, and a reason perhaps the more stringent referees of Champions League award a foul against them). Gabriel’s opening goal against West Ham United this week",
    "description2": "end was a classic instance, when Jurren Timber bumped into the back of Lucas Paquetá at the front post, denying him the space to jump and clear the ball. It swirled into the path of Gabriel, who hit the target. West Ham players rebelled for a lost cause. As have several other teams the last two seasons. Ben White tried to undo the gloves of Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario before one of the corner-kick goals. Keeping opponents guessing Whereas Gabriel’s movements have been similar - a shimmy to the right (when delivered from the right), an explosive leap as he scuds the ball goalward - the rest of their movements are unpredictable. Sometimes, they drift into the box like a swarm of bees. Sometimes, they scatter like a regiment after a drill. It’s synchronised chaos, so second-guessing their patterns becomes difficult. These are movements chiselled to perfection on the training ground under Jover’s watch. The coach, who joined Arteta from Manchester City after he thought he was not getting enough time to work on set-pieces with the champions, more reliant on open play than set-pieces for goals, polished their set-pieces with intense, opponent-specific drills. The onus is on specific runs to sharpen their movements. Players are given just two seconds to run into a specific point to receive the ball, with Jover insisting on repeating and re-repeating the action until it becomes second nature. The season before Jover took over, Arsenal had scored just six goals from set-pieces in the entire season. Arteta can’t stop praising him. “Him and the rest of the staff have injected the belief into the players that there are many ways to win football matches. This is a really powerful one and he has given us a lot,” he once said. Jover is not the pioneer in set-piece coaching, but its most efficient exponent. The 43-year-old Frenchman has never played competitive football, but after completing his sports degree in Canada, joined the French club Montpellier as video analyst, before camping with the Croatian national team as match analyst. It was at Brentford in 2016 that he assumed the role of free-kick specialist. This was around the time teams were starting to focus more on set-pieces than ever before rather than decrying its lack of aesthetics, even though 28 percent of all goals every season arrive in this fashion. Earlier, it was seen as the refuge of teams in the relegation zone (as Brentford was when Jover joined the Bees). But no team has mastered the set-piece art like Arsenal. At the heart of it is Jover.",

    "description1": "The former bowling coach of India Bharat Arun was startled to hear Mohammad Siraj’s voice in a phone call. “He sounded a touch sad, down, then,” Arun tells this newspaper on a day where Siraj thanked Arun for a turnaround in his fortunes in Australia. At the end of the game against Prime Ministers XI at Canberra, Siraj talked about how he has “rediscovered the joy of bowling,” and how in the recent past he was “trying too hard to get wickets” and when it didn't come, it led to a vicious loop. Everyone mattered, he said, told him to not to over-stress about wickets and just bowl. Be it Jasprit Bumrah, who told him “don’t worry about wickets, it will come in due time. If it doesn’t, come to me.” Or Morne Morkel, the current bowling coach, who told him, “You are a warrior, don’t worry, just bowl,” Siraj recalled at the end of the PM XI game. But it was Arun’s advice that would give him the confidence to forget about wickets and enjoy the process. Arun recalls the conversation at the end of the home Test series against New Zealand. Siraj had been dropped from the second Test against New Zealand. “He told me that the ball was sliding towards leg, he wasn’t getting the swing and the seam position didn’t feel as ideal as before,” Arun shares. “I had been watching him and had noticed a few changes and asked him what he had been trying. In his pursuit of wickets, he had felt that he had to increase his pace, try to get more swing/movement and was putting more effort at release.” But all that had messed up with his original method. “The main problem as I saw it was his wrist wasn’t behind the ball, his most crucial weapon. In his effort to increase the pace, all these mistakes were creeping up. Perhaps he felt a bit rushed at the crease. What happens then is your body can also slide/tilt a bit more, especially if you are an open-chested bowler like him. That meant his radar was now going down,” he explains. “Without the wrist at the right place, the seam position too was getting affected. And instead of getting more movement that he wanted, the bowling was getting affected,” he adds.

    "description2": "o has mentored Siraj through his first-class years, knows what will work for him. “It’s no use saying get the wrist behind the ball; when you are edgy and worried, all that doesn’t make sense. I know Siraj, he works best when you give him a simple bowling plan, a drill, say.” So, Arun told him in a subsequent conversation to aim at one stump, and keep bowling. “That’s the off stump, so to speak, and if he wants he can bring the ball from just outside or straight. Setting a simple target like that forces accuracy,” he details. “I then told him to bowl a lot of yorkers at that one stump. Now, this is not to improve his yorkers but to get the wrist in the right position behind the ball. You can’t bowl yorkers, good ones that is, without the wrist in the right position. If it’s tilted or out of shape, then the ball won’t go where you want it to go.” In the subsequent conversations, Arun says it was a happier Siraj who called him to say that the yorker plan had worked. “When the wrist is behind, the pace also increases automatically. The accuracy is a lot better, and you can actually then bowl what you want to bowl: be it the one that cuts back in or straightens,” he says. “I talked to Bharat Arun sir. He said this is what is happening with me. He had known me for a long time,” Siraj would say at the end of the PM XI. “ I have been bowling very well for the last six-seven months but I wasn’t getting wickets. As a human being, you start wondering why you’re not getting wickets. So just trying a little too hard to get the wickets led me to miss my lines and lengths a little. So I sat at home and thought about why this is happening to me.” That’s when the thought hit him that he should call his old coach Arun. The proof that the plan worked out would come in Perth, Arun knew. So he watched the game intently. “That Smith wicket in the second innings was the ideal Siraj for me. How much did it move? Not much. It’s not what he was trying to do when he was down and in poor form; he had wanted lots of movement etc. That’s not him, as in that’s not his bowling style,” he says. Subsequently, his shoulder didn’t fall away prior to release. “That helps the ball in straightening and when it did, Smith edged it. For Siraj, the main thing is the wrist behind the ball. That’s the sign; for him if that happens, it means other things are in place: he is not falling away, he is not pushing the ball down, and he is hitting the right lengths,” he says.",

    "description1": "For about 25 minutes in Game 6 on Sunday – which eventually resulted in a draw after 46 moves - Ding Liren spent his time on the board with feet dipped in the warm pool of false hope. The two queens had spent the last few moves waltzing in the middle of the board, their gaze locked at each other. Ding’s queen shuffled backwards and forwards on d5 and d6 squares, batting its eyelashes at its counterpart. D Gukesh’s queen seemed to be following its lead, moving between e7 and g5 squares. Then, when one more step on the g5 square would have solemnised a draw by threefold repetition - which would have seen both players head into the second rest day of the 2024 World Chess Championship at three points each – the Indian’s queen opted to swipe left. Instead of heading to the e7 square, Gukesh’s queen went to h4, rejecting the advances of Ding’s queen. The 18-year-old from Chennai had chosen to spurn his world champion opponent’s very evident draw offer. Gukesh was in no mood to down weapons this early. Not right before a rest day, at least. So instead of playing 26…Qe7 for the third time, he instead played 26…Qh4. Call it the heady optimism of youth, or just the opportunistic psychological prodding of a player who knows what his opponent wants, and is ready to suffer himself for as long as possible just so that the other player is denied what he craves. Ding threw a few accusatory looks at his opponent at this stage, as if the Indian teen had been leading him on. “I thought I might be slightly worse. I wasn’t sure if I was. With the files open in front of his king, I thought I had counterplay. I saw no reason to go for the repetition. Not like I was playing for the win or anything, but I just wanted to play a few more moves and see what happened,” Gukesh said nonchalantly at the post-game press conference. So when had Gukesh decided that he would not play for the draw? Was it the second time he repeated the moves? Or was it just before it was time to move the queen for the third time? READ MORE: At World Chess Championship, Ding not chilling. or having ice cream “When I moved it the second time, I had decided that I would not go for the draw,” he said. Gukesh was asked if this was a psychological ploy to get under Ding’s skin, to gauge the world champion’s intentions and then send a message that he was feeling up for a fight. “I just like playing chess, yeah?” smiled Gukesh. “It was more the position than a psychological thing. And I didn’t see too much danger fo",

Scroll down to read our updates in real time from Game 6. Contrasting approaches While Gukesh was living life on the edge, his mentor Viswanathan Anand was speaking in the FIDE commentary booth about how the 14-game World Chess Championship has played out thus far. “We’re seeing contrasting approaches. Ding is very solid with white. It's not like his ideas are lacking venom. But he’s not taking a lot of risks yet. Gukesh is pushing a bit more. But every once in a while, he stumbles. Yesterday, thanks to a miracle, he got away. Gukesh is putting more pressure, but needs to be more exact,\" Anand said about Saturday’s Game 5. Just as Anand had indicated, Ding was playing risk-free chess in Game 6. Gukesh was taking a devil-may-care approach that possibly would have made his backroom team squirm. After all, it’s the world chess championship. If you’re in a position to take a draw, while you’re in a worse position, you take a draw. But Gukesh was clearly not in the mood for that sort of logic. “Even in an inferior endgame, Gukesh is trying instead of opting for a draw… But he wins the respect of a lot of fans! ” tweeted chess legend Susan Polgar, who later added: “I would be super nervous playing black here. Not easy at all!” The game did end in a draw. The queens were traded by the 35th move, something Ding had been attempting to do as early as the 13th move, trying to throw his destroyer-in-chief on squares where both queens could be exchanged. But Gukesh resisted, before finally giving in. READ MORE: In contrast to inscrutable Gukesh, Ding Liren allows the world to see how he feels Just like in previous games, Ding had come out swinging on Sunday with his opening preparation. He blitzed his first 20 moves, spending barely seven minutes on them. In contrast, his teenage challenger was pushed into long phases of thought after the world champion employed the London System. Gukesh used up almost 53 minutes on his first 20 moves. At one point, Gukesh was trailing by as much as 45 minutes on the clock but managed to navigate himself out of trouble. But eventually, not just out-maneuvering himself out of trouble, he was also actively courting it in some phases. The result means that both players head into the second rest day of the world chess championship even on three points each.",

    "description1": "Vaibhav Surayvanshi was in an India U-19 team meeting ahead of their Asia Cup preparation when a member of the coaching staff broke the news to the 13-year-old that he had been picked by Rajasthan Royals in the IPL mega auction on Monday. Aged 13 years, 243 days, Vaibhav became the youngest player to be signed in IPL history following a bidding war between the Royals and Delhi Capitals, the former ultimately securing him for Rs 1.1 crore. \"I am speechless.I don't know what to say. It's a massive thing for our family. I had a gut feeling that he would get picked but never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that there would be a bidding war,\" Vaibhav's father Sanjeev Suryavanshi tells The Indian Express. The youngster grabbed eyeballs recently when he became the youngest batter (13 years, 288 days) to record an international century, scoring 104 off 62 balls in a Youth Test for India Under-19 against Australia U-19 in Chennai. The left-hander’s century came in 58 balls, making it the fastest Youth Test hundred by an Indian and the second-fastest overall in the world. \"Everything is coming as a flashback to me. I was a cricket tragic myself. But had to kill that dream when I moved to Mumbai at the age of 19 to earn money. I did a lot of jobs. I worked as a bouncer in a nightclub in Colaba, worked at a Sulabh toilet,\" recollects an emotional Sanjeev. \"All those 12 years I spent in Mumbai, I used to think when my luck would change. Now my son has made it a reality. I don't know what the future holds but after this, I won't have to borrow money from anyone for his cricket,\" he adds.

    "description2": " is coming back to Bihar. Ranji Trophy has returned. A budget of Rs 450 crore has already been passed to renovate Moin-ul-Haq stadium in Patna. And now Vaibhav has burst onto the scene. He will play for India in the future for sure,\" BCA President Rakesh Tiwari tells this newspaper. Sanjeev is happy that his son will be under the wings of his favourite player Rahul Dravid, who is now at the helm in Rajasthan Royals. \"Over the years, Royals have groomed the youngsters. Be it Sanju Samson, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Dhruv Jurel or Riyan Parag, all are products of the Rajasthan Royals franchise. I sincerely hope that Vaibhav will also follow the same path,\" says Sanjeev, who hails from Bihar's Samstipur district. Vaibhav's childhood coach Manoj Ojha, echoes the sentiments of Sanjeev: \"Perfect for Vaibhav. There is no better franchise for a youngster than Rajasthan Royals.\" \"VVS Laxman rates him very highly and monitors his development. He said last year that the next two years are going to be very crucial for Vaibhav. If someone like VVS Laxman is praising him, then there must be something special in the kid,\" says Ojha. In five Ranji Trophy matches Vaibhav has played, he is yet to set the stage on fire. He has managed only 100 runs with a highest score of 41 against Madhya Pradesh. However, on Saturday, making his debut in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in Rajkot, he smoked Rajasthan's left-arm pacer Aniket Choudhary for two sixes before being dismissed for 13 off six deliveries. The one thing that worried Sanjeev was how his son would deal with all this price tag pressure. \"Money is good. Whatever I get, it will go in his fix-deposit. But my biggest fear is how he will deal with this situation. I am yet to have a word with him. I will talk to him and will make sure that this IPL auction doesn't get into his head, he still has a long way to go,” the father says. Vaibhav will be in action for India U-19 in their Asia Cup match against arch-rivals Pakistan on Saturday in Dubai.",

    "description1": "India vs Australia: Sometime in the afternoon at Perth, Fox Sports showed a split-screen visual. On the right side of the frame was Nitish Reddy running into bowl. On the left was one of the world’s greatest fast bowlers Dennis Lillee steaming in. Perhaps, they saw some similarity in the load-up of the left leg. Or perhaps Australia has gone all soft in lionising India. “What the hell is that? Why is that kid shown with Dennis; he is not even India’s main-line bowler, is he?,” an elderly lady scorer, who has seen Lillee terrorising batsmen, exclaimed in shock. In some ways, the visuals were apt: the question before the series was whether India’s youngsters can perform in alien and hostile Australian conditions. Within four days, one of them has been propped up next to a pace legend. How quickly can things change? Nothing went against the script on the final day, with India downing Australia, overnight on 12 for 3, for 238. Only Travis Head crossed 50; he made an attacking 89 before Jasprit Bumrah, the man of the match, ended his stay. “When you lose a Test like this, there is a lot of hurt in the change room,” Pat Cummins said at the end. Conversely, when a team wins after being bowled out for 150, the feeling is one of pride. “I am very proud,” Bumrah talked about how he enjoyed being a captain and about his team. Everything that India wished went in their favour, after that 150 all out at tea on the first day. The youngsters showed they belonged: be it Harshit Rana, who possibly produced the ball of the match when he knocked down the off stump of Travis Head, a game-turning moment in the first innings. Be it Nitish Reddy whose plucky 41 in the first innings gave the Indian bowlers something to work with, and whose breezy 38 in the second allowed Virat Kohli the room to not worry about doing it on his own when declaration was around the corner. Be it Jaiswal, not a debutant but whose second-innings hundred reflected such maturity in the way he took his time (when he crossed his fifty, it was the slowest he had ever taken off 123 balls), that Bumrah too made a point to mention about that initial phase he kept leaving the ball. Or be it KL Rahul, who showed such reassuring form in both innings and in the way he mentored Jaiswal in the se",
    "description2": "cond. Even the relative non-performances with the bat of Dhruv Jurel, who took the catch of the game with a stunning reflex pouch at short-leg to dismiss Mitch Starc in the second innings, and Devdutt Padikkal who wasn’t too bad, means selection headaches for India with Rohit Sharma, who had a batting stint at Perth nets against the pink ball, and Shubman Gill returning for the second Test. Discipline and thinking On Monday, yet again India’s discipline and thinking stood out. They tailored their bowling according to the demands of the up-and-down pitch, and according to the batsmen. Usman Khawaja, who likes to pull off the front foot, was thrown a sucker short ball but outside off by Mohammad Siraj. Perhaps the ball didn’t come on at the pace he expected and allied with the fact that he was fetching it from outside off, a top edge resulted which was taken by Rishabh Pant. India also didn’t allow Steve Smith to return to form before the second Test. After initially looking confident, he was slowly nailed to the crease, and Siraj induced an edge with a straightener outside off stump. Mitch Marsh was made to sweat hard for his 47 as Bumrah hit his body a few times with carefully curated slower cutters. In the end, Nitish Reddy took him out, again the pitch playing a part with an inside-edge on to the stumps. It was during that spell that he found himself alongside Lillee on international coverage. Nathan Lyon was foxed with a lovely straightener on the off stump from Washington Sundar and lost his off stump. Even the end was noteworthy. Rana, who had impressed many with his pace, bouncers, and control, slipped in a cool slower ball to take out a stubborn Alex Carey. Bumrah and KL Rahul picked stumps and just when it seemed there might be big celebrations, Indians turned quiet. Gentle handshakes, hands around each other’s shoulders, taps on the back - and they were off. Almost as if it was just another day in the office, and not one of the biggest days in Australian soil. In 2021, they bounced back from the depths of 36 all out with a memorable win in Melbourne. But here, in 2024 Perth, they have bounced back in the same Test they were tottering after the nightmarish first innings. There is nothing ordinary about this extraordinary triumph.",

    "description1": "On the eve of the series-opener in Perth, just before the Border-Gavaskar trophy unveiling, Jasprit Bumrah was excitedly chatting about his son with Australian captain Pat Cummins. He would return to his kid at the end of a sensational come-from-behind win. “My young son was in the stands. He was also there at the T20 World Cup win. He won’t know anything now, but I now have stories to tell him when he grows up; how he was there during special Indian wins.” For a particular generation of older fans, to experience India playing cricket in Australia in the last decade has been a sweet erasure of a torrid past. In 2014, they stood up to Australia; in 2018, they knocked down Australia; in 2021, they seemed on the mat, but conjured a triumph for a lifetime. This 2024 series started like a bad dream, a whitewash at home, absences of key players, doubts about the new management’s working relationship with players. On the first day in Perth India crashed and burned — 150 all out in four hours on a bright sunny Australian day. Yet, within that day, the turnaround had begun, and that was not just consolidated over the next three days but an utter domination was achieved as India wrapped up the first Test in Perth in some style: a 295-run win, India's biggest in terms of runs in Australia. Bumrah would nail down the turning point moment as the one that came after the lowest moment in the Test. “The most positive thing was when we were out for 150. There was no one in the dressing room who was down. They believed that if we could get out like that, we could do the same to them. My only message to the team was not to get too desperate as sometimes bowling teams can do that after getting bowled out cheaply. I told them there was enough on the pitch if we hit the right areas.” Aptly, a debutant helped apply the final seal of victory. Harshit Rana, who had sparkled in the first innings, too, produced a crafty slower ball to castle the stumps of Alex Carey to trigger celebrations. By the time stand-in captain Bumrah could get to the stumps at the non-striker’s end, KL Rahul, whose partnership with Yashasvi Jaiswal in the second innings had set up a huge target, had plucked out two stumps, and he gave one to his skipper. Rana had by then gone on to hug Virat Kohli, who later walked away with Bumrah with their hands around each other’s shoulders. It was a job well done. On the fourth day, only Tra",
    "description2": "vis Head offered resistance with a fine 89, even as India rammed through the rest to seal a special win. Last time around in 2021, they had taken the first-innings lead in the opening Test at Adelaide but collapsed for 36 in the second innings to lose that game. No such mistakes this time around. It’s one thing to hang in there, slowly claw back, grit out a bruising fight-back after being down by tea on opening day, but India decided against that old romantic sporting cliche; instead, they chose to boss and own Australia. Time will tell how the rest of the series goes but this performance has now cancelled out all pre-series fears of a one-sided contest. Josh Hazlewood had given up the ghost on the third evening itself when instead of any brave talk of fightback, he said he hoped a couple of batsmen would get to 80 or 100, and tire down the Indian bowlers a bit. One of those batsmen, and a very important one for Australia if they are to bounce back in the series, was Steve Smith. Especially after Usman Khawaja went early, trying to pull a Mohammed Siraj short delivery from outside off, top-edging it to Rishabh Pant. Smith was sorted out by Bumrah for a first-ball duck in the first innings when he had pressed back far too early, and couldn’t get his wrists to effect the jail-break for him. On Monday, on a track that was playing up-and-down, his task was that much more arduous. He did try gamely, trying to play straight. As his innings progressed though, he began to get stuck at the crease, and his hands were doing all the contortions to keep him out there. But then came a length ball from Mohammad Siraj in the off-stump channel and Smith, not only stuck at crease but on his toes almost jammed together, and pushed out his bat to snick it behind. Head did what he usually does to India: slash, carve, smash, swat. And Bumrah brought himself back to end his stay with a straightener outside off that caught the outside edge of an attempted forcing punch shot and flew through to Rishabh Pant. With it, the Australian fight faded out of the arena rather quickly but not before Dhruv Jurel produced the catch of the game, plucking one out of thin air at short-leg to get rid of Mitch Starc. A little later, when the victory was sealed, a digital advertisement flashed around on the first tier of the stadium: \"Do Great Things\" . They could have added \"like India\" – to capture some ground reality.",

    "description1": "In his first show as Manchester United manager, a draw at Ipswich Town, Ruben Amorim didn’t shed too many emotions. He smiled faintly when United scored just 82 seconds into the game, a goal that owed to his tactical rejig. With brown brooding eyes he watched his team fluctuate between energetic and erratic, bouts of purposeless possession dotted with spells of confusion. His reactions on the touchline were mild, no frantic gesturing, no guttural carnage of instructions, no pacing up and down the technical area, or no busy jot-notes. How long the facade of calm would last, or how long before his nerves begin to snap has to be seen. The reeling, flailing club could make Mahatma Gandhi take up arms; or Mother Teresa lose her patience. Even before joining the club, he would have realised the extent of his task, the burden he has embraced. He would have sized up his team’s defects in the training sessions during the international break and by talking to the support staff, but watching them in a full, live match would have offered a clearer, broader picture of the unforgiving mission he had signed up for. “We are going to suffer for a long period,” he said after the game, matter-of-factly and not with grimness. The refreshing bit of the admission was his honesty. He is not delusional enough to project himself as a miracle healer. He has not promised titles and trophies, he has not proclaimed to knock Pep Guardiola off his perch, a verbal faux pas of his predecessor Erik Ten Hag. A tenacious midfielder in his playing days, he sounded realistic and pragmatic. Instead, he dwelled on his “idea” of playing the game. “I think you will see an idea. You would like it or not, I don’t know, but you will see an idea. We will have problems, the players will be confused sometimes but we have to address the new idea and try to be better for this stage next year,” he explained. The new “idea” is a back three, two wingbacks lurking on the touchline, a staggered central midfield pair, two No 10s pulling the string behind a classical No 9. The formation, when employed with the right men could be both dynamic and sturdy, offer goals and defensive stability. But United don’t have the men to make this system work. It requires untiring legs and lungs at the heart of the midfield. Amorim paired Cristian Eriksen and Casemiro, both ageing and slow, their best days long gone. Once Kobbie Mainoo returns fully fit from his injury and Manuel Ugarte internalises the tune and tempo of the league, they could form a more potent duo. The Eriksen-",
    "description2": "Casemiro duet was never going to work against an aggressively pressing Ipswich Town. They cut swathes through the United midfield. But Amorim didn’t flinch from his trusted methods, even though he knew the inherent risks. He didn’t possess the right men in his three-man defence. It made Jonny Evans, 36, look his age. He was slow and ponderous, culpable for Ipswich’s equaliser, a couple of mistakes redeemed by the reflexes of goalkeeper Andre Onana. Matthias de Lit is not the quickest around. Neither are the back-ups Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelöf. Apart from the injury-savvy Lisandro Martinez, none of them possess the bark and bite that Amorim loves in his back-line. “It is not a system or formation, it’s like the character of the players, the way they see the club that matters the most,” he said. Striking the balance would be key in the first season, where he has to work with the men at his disposal, even though they don’t blend in with his formula. The incoherence at Portman Road thus was understandable. But there were green shoots of promise too. When rhyme and rhythm sync, their forward line could be exhilarating to watch. Two-touch passing was marvellous at times, Bruno Fernandes relished his newfound freedom, the wingbacks Amad Diallo and Diogo Dalot buzzed and channeled their creative forces. Diallo could emerge as the most important player in his side. For the opening goal, his deft and precise passing with Fernandes freed up space upfront, he was so quick that he took out two defenders, freeing up Dalot, Garnacho and Rashford, who eventually scored. It was a glimpse into the bright, brave world Amorim promises. There were other positives too. The short, slick quick passes in the buildup were effective when they came off. The press was aggressive to start with. Two-touch passes were delicious at times. But United could sustain none of these throughout the 90 minutes. With refinement, their passing could be top-notch; with fitter players, their press could be relentless. Amorim has been emphasising on physicality, and deeper into the season, United could shed their soft-as-pudding disposition, especially when defending. The coordination would also improve once they get used to the new conductor. But most importantly, they have a gaffer who is not deluded by the past glories; realistic enough to admit that his team is in for a tough time in the coming months of flux; humble enough to not shout war-cries and wise enough to offer hollow promises, but brave enough to stick to his ideas and convictions.",

    "description1": "\n\n\nJohannesburg [South Africa], December 2 (ANI): As the SA20 league continues to grow, prominent cricket figures Graeme Smith, Dinesh Karthik, and Mark Boucher share their perspectives on where they see the league in the next decade. Their insights highlight the potential and ambition driving the tournament forward.\nGraeme Smith, the League Commissioner of SA20, reflects on the league's future with cautious optimism at SA20 India Day.\n\n\"I think 10 years is always tough to predict. But I think if we can follow at a level the same curve as IPL, that would be amazing,\" he said, as quoted by a release from SA20.\nSmith emphasized the importance of captivating fans in a competitive entertainment landscape.\n\"There's a lot of options for fans in today's world. We want to make sure that in our window that people are excited and tune in every year to see what SA20 is doing like they do with IPL, Premier League, football and others. We want to be one of the most established leagues and biggest outside India,\" he noted at SA20 India Day.\n\n\nIndian cricketer Dinesh Karthik envisions greater involvement from Indian players in the SA20 league over the next decade. He acknowledges the current BCCI policy but expresses hope for future participation. He is also the India Ambassador of SA20.\n\"In 10 years down the line, I can say that o",
    "description2": "bviously there is a policy in BCCI and everyone is adhering to that policy. But I hope I'm the first number to come out and play this league because I can definitely share my experience post the league how it was on a personal front,\" Karthik stated, as quoted by a release from SA20.\nHe highlighted the league's potential to enhance players' skills and financial stability.\n\"At the end of the day, all active players are looking for two things. A) How do I get better as a player? B) Financially, how is it viable? And on both fronts, I can confidently say that this segment is at a place which is definitely helping every player who is part of it,\" he said at SA20 India Day.\nMark Boucher, who is also the ambassador of SA20 league, also sees a bright future for the tournament. He draws parallels with the IPL's successful model, suggesting that SA20 could expand in a similar manner.\n\"I think to answer that as well, the template there and what the IPL has done. And you've got IPL owners involved in SA20 as well. So 10 years down the line, who used to say that there won't be another 4 or 5 teams? The template is there and it has certainly worked. So as long as SA20 carry on the same template, following the IPL, with the IPL owners, who's to know, I think it's going to be very successful,\" Boucher said, as quoted by SA20. (ANI)\n",

    "description1": "\n\n\nATK\nNew Delhi [India], December 2: The Grammy Awards 2025, which is also the 67th edition of the event, will take place on the 2nd of February 2025 and the nominations were just recently announced on the 8th of November. There are nominations that were expected and did not surprise anyone, but there are also big artists who did not get any nominations and as such, this disappointed them and their fans.\n\nGrammy Awards are intended to evaluate the performance of music talents globally, so it is an international awards show giving praise to artists from all around for what they have brought to the music industry in the past year. Some of the most famous Canadian celebrities couldn't miss this year's nominations either and this is totally deserving based on the work they have done.\nIn this article, we will see which of the Canadian artists made it to the 2025 Grammy Nominations. Additionally, we will briefly cover Canadian emerging artists and talents who also got nominated.\nHow do songs/albums/artists get nominated for Grammys?\nThe Grammy Nominations are given by the Recording Academy. The Recording Academy is a society of music professionals based in the United States. Simply put, this academy has a certain number of members who have the right to vote, and it is through their votes that the nominations happen. To ensure that this judgment is unbiased and solely based on the work of the artist, the members of this academy are chosen carefully, and they all have lengthy expertise in the area.\nWhich Canadian artist made it to the nominations for Grammy 2025?\nThe leading nominee for the Grammy Awards 2025 was Beyonce with 11 nominations in total, which brings the number of nominations of a Grammy to 99 throughout her entire career. However, big names from Canada such as The Weeknd and Kaytranda were also nominated for more than one category.\nKaytranda, or better known as DJ Kaytranda, is a Canadian artist born and raised in Montreal.\nKaytranda has already taken home two Grammys in 2021, one for the category Best Dance/Electronic Album with his album \"BUBBA\" and Best Dance Recording for his single \"10%\". His talent for producing electronic music that is blended with hip-hop, and dance was recognized by the academy and as a result, he was nominated for three top categories as follows:\n* Best Dance/Electronic Album with his latest album titled \"Timeless\"\n* Best Dance/Electronic Recording with his single \"Witchy\"\n* Best Remix Recording with his remix of Doechii's \"Alter Ego\"\nThese are all super importan",
    "description2": "t categories for the genre of music he produces, so the nomination alone is a big achievement for Kaytranda.\n\n\nThe Weeknd on the other hand has already earned 4 Grammys in total while he was nominated 13 times during his career. He won the first and second Grammy for the Best Urban Contemporary Album with his \"Beauty Behind the Madness\" in 2015 and \"Starboy\" in 2018. He also won the Best R&B Performance for the soundtrack \"Earned It\" which was also featured in the movie \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" and Best Melodic Rap Performance with his featuring in \"Hurricane\" by Kanye West.\nFor this upcoming Grammy, The Weeknd was nominated for two of the following categories:\n* Best Melodic Rap Performance for his contribution on \"We Still Don't Trust You\" by Future and Metro Boomin\n* Best Rap Album for the collaborative piece with the same name \"We Still Don't Trust You\"\nOther Canadian music producers who got nominations for Grammy 2025\nApart from DJ Kaytranada and the Weeknd, there are other Canadian artists who also got nominated for the Grammy Awards of 2025. Here is a full list of them:\n* Best Metal Performance for Spiritbox's track \"Cellar Door\"\n* Best Traditional Blues Album for Sue Foley's \"One Guitar Woman\"\n* Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media and Best Opera Recording for the infamous conductor Yannick Nezet-Seguin\n* Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical for Charlotte Day Wilson's \"Cyan Blue\"\nThese are some emerging artists and producers who bring so much talent and potential to the music industry and their nominations are undoubtedly a successful achievement. In case any of them win the Grammy in 2025, then that would simply seal the potential they have for the music industry, but it should be noted that the nominations alone are done by music experts and only being nominated for a Grammy is a huge success.\nA proud moment for Canada\nUltimately, this was a proud moment for Canada. The constant contribution of Canadian artists to the music industry goes to show the country's diverse and well-deserving music scene. Canada's presence at the Grammys has been felt for years now and every year at least a few Canadian celebrities are nominated for the awards.\nIt is already anticipated that the Grammy Awards 2025 will once again be a memorable event for the music industry, and we are sure the Canadian artists alongside the others will shine on this global stage!\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by ATK.

    "description1": "\n\n\nLondon [UK], December 2 (ANI): Former footballer Gary Neville reacted to Liverpool's massive 2-0 win over Manchester City in the ongoing Premier League (PL) season and said that Arne Slot's side are the \"strong favourites\" to win the title.\nIn a game that showcased Liverpool's dominance. Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo led the Reds to the victory over City, significantly distancing themselves from their Premier League title rivals.\n\nNeville said that Liverpool have a nine points difference from second-place Arsenal, for which there's an expectation that the Merseyside club can bag the silverware this season.\n\"There's a real expectation but they'll be very, very strong favourites. Nine points clear of Arsenal, 11 points clear of Manchester City and there's still four or five months to go. The title race doesn't start until April. We're just in early December,\" Neville was quoted by Sky Sports as saying.\nHe accepted that there's a long way to go to decide who will win the title. The former footballer further added that Liverpool might have a difficult patch at some point in the season.\n\n\n\"I'm not saying Liverpool are going to win the league. I still think there's a long way to go. But there is no d",

I think they will have a difficult patch at some point in the season,\" he added.\nLiverpool's breakthrough came in the 12th minute, with Salah delivering a precise pass that allowed Gakpo to tap the ball into the net. Gakpo was instrumental in stretching City's defense and displayed impressive pace and positioning, contributing significantly to Liverpool's attacking prowess.\nDespite City growing into the game and managing just one shot on goal compared to Liverpool's ten in the first half, the visitors struggled to create significant opportunities. Liverpool had a chance to seal the victory earlier when Salah was through on goal, but the Egyptian uncharacteristically fired over the crossbar.\nThe game was finally put to bed in the 78th minute when Salah converted a penalty, awarded after Luis Diaz was fouled by Ortega.\nThis victory propelled the Merseyside club nine points clear of second-placed Arsenal and eleven points ahead of defending champions Manchester City, solidifying their position at the top of the Premier League table.

Reflecting on the national team's achievements, Smith highlighted the positive impact of the SA20 on both the men's and women's teams.\n\"I definitely, I mean, I've been saying that from the start. You know, I think our domestic cricket had kind of levelled off in South Africa. We now have a tournament that puts 70 South Africans up against the best international talent. They're working with franchises that bring real expertise back into the game. They're playing in front of big crowds, which brings pressure. The TV production is of international standards,\" Smith explained as per a release by SA20.\n\nThe SA20 league has provided a platform for South African players to compete at a high level, exposing them to the pressures and standards of international cricket.

    "description1": "\n\n\nJohannesburg [South Africa], December 2 (ANI): Dinesh Karthik, the first Indian cricketer to join the SA20 league, is eager to embark on this new chapter with the Paarl Royals. Reflecting on his connection with South Africa and his observations of the league, Karthik shared his excitement and insights.\n\"So I've watched both the editions very closely because a lot of the players that I've played with in IPL teams have played in that tournament. That's one. And South Africa has been a very fond place for me because of the memories I've had,\" Karthik, who is the India Ambassador of SA20, stated at SA20 India Day.\n\nHis fondness for South Africa stems from his past experiences, including a successful stint as a Test player and memorable World Cup moments.\nKarthik praised the strong domestic cricket culture in South Africa, which he believes has significantly contributed to the success of the SA20 league.\n\"When SA20 came up and you watch other tournaments, the one thing that's very evident is teams which have a strong domestic cricket culture come through with these franchise tournaments very well. And the fact that South Africa has had a very good domestic structure over a period of time, I think you could almost say they were frontrunners to be a very good tournament,\" he explained, as quoted by a press release from SA20.\n\n\nHe also commended the six franchises participating in the league for their impre",
    "description2": "ssive player selections.\n\"The teams that assemble there, the six franchises that represent the domestic structure there, have been very good in terms of the assortment of players they've got. They've almost got the top players across batters, bowlers, in the ICC rankings as we speak. So it was a very well-fought tournament,\" Karthik remarked.\nThe involvement of IPL franchises has added an intriguing dynamic to the SA20 league.\n\"Add to the fact that the Indian franchise is very interested in it. Made it a certain rivalry which almost already exists. So it's been a very interesting take for me. It was the first tournament where all the franchises were bought over by IPL teams purely because they knew how far that tournament would go. And it stood strong and it stood true to the testament to the fact that they've invested and today, they see the growth of this tournament,\" Karthik said.\nExpressing his enthusiasm about joining the Paarl Royals, Karthik concluded, \"So I'm very happy to be part of it. And from afar, observing it, I only have good things to say. It's just that I was happy I got picked up by the Royals. Any other offer from anybody else, I would have been tempted as well.\"\nAs Karthik prepares to take part in the SA20 league, his experience and perspective promise to bring an exciting new dimension to the tournament, enhancing the competitive spirit and international appeal of the event.

    "description1": "\n\n\nJohannesburg [South Africa], December 2 (ANI): As the SA20 league continues to grow, comparisons with the Indian Premier League (IPL) are inevitable, especially given the similarities in franchise names and ownership. Graeme Smith, the League Commissioner of SA20, shared his thoughts on these comparisons and the potential for increased participation of Indian players in the league at the SA20 India Day.\nWhen asked about the potential for more Indian players joining SA20, Smith emphasized the importance of working closely with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).\n\n\"I mean, I think we always work with the BCCI. Obviously, they have policies in place with regard to Indian players. The talent in India is so loved in South Africa as well. You can see when the Indian team comes out there, just the talk on the streets, the fans, you know, they can't wait to see these type of players in South African conditions and the competitive nature that it brings,\" Smith explained at the SA20 India Day, as quoted by a release from SA20.\nSmith highlighted the strong relationship between Indian and South African cricket fans, noting the excitement that Indian players bring to the SA20 league.\n\"And, I think since South Africa came back into sports, India has been a great friend to South Africa. The fans in India have certainly built a strong relationship with South African cricket. So, from the SA20 perspective, India is a very important market for us. The fan base here is cricket loving, and we want to grow and make sure that as many people tune in and love the game,\" he said.\n\n\nThe inclusion of Indian players in SA20 would be a significant boost for the league.\n\"Obviously, Indian pla",
    "description2": "yers help that from our perspective, but quality tournaments that people enjoy watching, Indian fans enjoy competitive cricket. So, for us, those are all sort of key ingredients. We don't know what the growth looks like into the future. We think with the six IPL franchises that we're perfectly situated to be able to attract top talent out of India, if allowed,\" Smith noted.\nRegarding the comparisons between SA20 and IPL, Smith acknowledged the differences in playing conditions and development phases.\n\"Look, I mean, cricketing-wise, it's obviously different. We saw in the IPL last year, I mean, batting conditions in the early season was, I think, you know, around South Africa, in our six stadiums, you get different conditions from the Wanderers to Cape Town to Paarl and so on,\" Smith explained, as quoted from a release by SA20.\nSmith pointed out that SA20 has not adopted the impact player rule and is focused on attracting new fans to the game in South Africa.\n\"We've not gone with the impact player rule. We're in an early phase of development and, you know, really also trying to attract new fans to the game in South Africa. So, sticking to kind of, what's worked in T20 cricket for us and introducing fans to the game. But you can't compare to IPL. I mean, it's just on another level. I've been fortunate to win the first year of IPL and be a part of many more from, player, broadcaster. So it's just an incredible thing to be a part of. And, for us, it's an ambition to even be in the same room as the IPL,\" Smith said.\nSmith's insights underscore the unique aspects of SA20 while recognizing the league's aspirations to grow and potentially match the success of the IPL in the future.

    "description1": "NEW DELHI: It's a tricky one for India. Rohit Sharma is available to resume opening the batting with Yashasvi Jaiswal, but KL Rahul dug in hard as an opener in Perth to find form and make a difference. Should then the skipper accommodate himself in his usual position, or follow the don't-mend-what-is-not-broken theory and let what's working, work?It's hard to not look back at that 36 all out in the pink-ball Test four Australian summer agos, when you are heading to the same venue to face similar music under lights. The absence of Josh Hazlewood, who broke India's back while hunting in a pair with Pat Cummins during that December evening of 2020, can't be taken as a discount. India will still have Mitchell Starc and Cummins breathing down their neck. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEfgfM5Qc-oRohit wasn't part of that eleven when Virat Kohli was the team's captain; and he would now want to lead from the front, especially when India have the momentum after winning the opening Test in Perth and a place in the World Test Championship final hinging on this five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy. Rohit got his first feel of Australian conditions under lights against the pink ball in the warm-up game against the Australian PM's XI, where he didn't open and let Rahul and Jaiswal continue as openers. Is that a sign of things to come in Adelaide or a bluff played by Rohit? Time will tell. But Rahul and Jaiswal, who stitched 201-run partnership in the second innings of the Perth Test, did their chances no harm with a solid 75-run stand after negotiating the initial threat from Scott Boland, who is likely to replace the injured Hazlewood in Australia's XI at the Adelaide Oval. Rohit came out to bat at No. 4 and lasted only 11 balls, scoring just 3. In six Test innings before that, against New Zealand at home, Rohit aggregated just 91 runs. Conclusions drawn from the above point towards not dislodging Rahul as an opener for Adelaide, which would mean Rohit batting",
    "description2": " in the middle order. And there are reasons why India should take that path. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4D4aa9co2sTHE PINK-BALL DANGERBatting under the lights in Australia as an opener is in itself a challenge, and the pink ball makes it that much tougher. On top of that, if the batter doesn't have runs under his belt lately, which is the case with Rohit, the confidence is shaken. In that scenario, if you have two openers who have been doing the job in such challenging conditions, it's better to let them continue rather than disturb the team combination.That in no way questions Rohit's skills or his ability to return to form as an opener. It's just the need of the hour.RAHUL BACK IN FORMIndia put their trust in out-of-form Rahul to pick him in the squad for Australia. He repaid that faith with his good show in the first Test and is now looking more assured against the Australia pacers. In a long series like this, teams are always looking for batters who are in form and confident.Rahul has started in that fashion with a total of 103 runs (26 and 77) in his two innings at Perth. Not to forget he consumed 250 balls in scoring that runs, doing the job that Cheteshwar Pujara did during India's back-to-back Test triumphs in Australia on the last two tours.If Rahul can do a Pujara for most of this series, India can't ask for more. ROHIT MUST PLAY THE WAITING GAME TO FIND TOUCHMany former players have pointed out the fact that Rohit's immediate instinct when put under pressure is to attack, which can work in white-ball cricket but is a dangerous option when it comes to Tests. His attacking short-format instincts as an opener is possibly why the skipper is finding that much harder to switch to a more controlled approach in order to rediscover his form against the red ball.It could, thus, be a blessing in disguise for Rohit to bide his time in the middle order, where he can play the waiting game and find the middle of his bat by milking the bowlers.",

I think we're finding that at the moment -- how challenging he can be, and it's nice to play against that,\" Head told reporters on Monday.\"It's gonna be nice to go back and look at your career and go tell the grandkids that you faced him. So not a bad series of playing with him. Hopefully I'll face a few more times, but he is as being challenging,\" he added.With a match-haul of 8/72, which included several crucial wickets, Bumrah, who was captaining India, led from the front and displayed his outstanding form. His outstanding achievement this year was evidence of his extraordinary consistency.ALSO WATCH:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FX-HLpROaUHe was voted Player-of-the-Series at the T20 World Cup earlier this year, as he was instrumental in India's title victory.The top order, which included Steve Smith, Usman Khawaja, and Marnus Labuschagne, struggled, and Head was the only Australian batter to reach fifty. However, the powerful middle-order batsman is positive that his teammates won't be coming to him for advice.\"They are not coming to me for batting tips, that's for sure. Everyone goes about it in different ways. We'll have a chat over the next three or four days.\"(Bumrah) is so unique, and that's with any of the bowlers, really. Every (batter) picks up different cues and goes about it in a different way.\"Following a brief break, the Australian team reassembled on Monday.On Friday, the two teams will begin a pink ball Test match in Adelaide at the same venue where India were dismissed for 36 on their 2020 visit.Recalling that match, Head said, \"I r",
    "description2": "emember that it was a quick Test, so it was good. We got to enjoy all of the bits of Adelaide afterwards.\"It'll be nice to do that again. Don't know if we can revisit. It wouldn't take very long to watch it. I don't think that will happen this week.\"&mdash; BCCI (@BCCI) Australia last played a pink ball Test in January, while India played a day-night match against the Prime Minister's XI over the weekend.\"It's been a long time since we played one (pink ball), India got another look at it last night. Everyone's well experienced enough, especially that team as well, that in your international level.\"I think you can accustomed to things pretty quickly. I don't think it'll take them long to be prepared for it, and same as us.\"There is no \"divide\" between Australia's bowling squad and their faltering batting, Head claimed. After Josh Hazlewood's remark during the first Test, there were suggestions of a potential rift within the team.\"We hold high expectations for both sides (batting and bowling) and it's a very individualised sport,\" Head said.\"So batters, we want to hold our own - we know how good our bowlers have been for us in the past and they've got us out of trouble a lot. As a batting group, we know that if we get enough runs on the board, we put ourselves in a great position.\"As a batter myself, I try to take a whole lot of pride in what I do, and knowing that if I can set it up for the big boys, that they can knock it down for us, so definitely no divide,\" Head said.Head believed that the Australians would recover from their terrifying performance in Perth.\"This team has dealt with adversity well. The small amount that we have had in the last three or four years, we have played well.\"We've had some challenging times and a couple of challenging Tests last year. We didn't have a very good week. That's fine. But we have got four more opportunities to do it, we will crack on as we do, as we have done for the last few years.\"Over the last couple of years, there's a lot of teams that lost the first Test or gone down in the series and brought it back and played really well.\"",

In comparison to Australia playing 12 day-night Tests, India have played just four and their only loss came in the one that they played against the Aussies in Adelaide on their last tour Down Under.

    "description1": "NEW DELHI: After a routine home series against New Zealand, Mohammed Siraj has praised his senior pace teammate and attack leader Jasprit Bumrah for helping him get back in form. Siraj took five wickets in India's incredible comeback victory over Australia in the Perth Test. The 30-year-old had a rough home season, taking just two wickets in two Test matches during India's crushing 0-3 defeat to New Zealand before the visit to Australia. However, he was back to his best in the first Test match against Australia.Border-Gavaskar TrophySiraj claimed that his recovery in the series opener in Perth, when India overcame a first innings collapse to reach 150 for a huge 295-run victory, was aided by a conversation he had with Bumrah, the No. 1 ranked Test bowler and stand-in captain, before the tour.\"I always keep talking to Jassi bhai (Bumrah),\" Siraj said after the India's six-wicket win over Australian Prime Minister's XI in a practice match Canberra on Sunday.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FX-HLpROaU\"Even before the first match, I spoke with him about what I was going through. And he just told me one thing -- don't run (chase) after wickets, just keep bowling consistently in one area and enjoy your bowling. If you still don't get wickets, then you come ask me.\"So I enjoyed my bowling and I got wickets as well,\" he added.Bharat Arun, the former bowling coach for India, was also consulted by Siraj in order to determine his center.\"I spoke with Bharat Arun sir, that this ",
    "description2": "is what's happening with me, because he has known me for a while and he has seen my bowling from long time back. So, he just told me to enjoy and not run after wickets. Just enjoy and you'll get wickets.\"And before travelling, I met (fielding coach) Dilip sir in Hyderabad and we practised together as well. So, it felt good and now I'm enjoying.\"Morne (Morkel, India's current bowling coach) keeps telling me that 'you are a warrior'. 'You'll get us wickets, but you just keep enjoying your bowling'.\"In his first game with a pink ball, Siraj appeared to be in rhythm during the warm-up play against the Prime Minister's XI. Matthew Renshaw, a former Australian Test batter, was taken out by him.Adelaide will host the day-night second Test match against Australia starting on Friday. Siraj would be bowling with the pink ball under the lights for the first time.\"The (pink) ball has a synthetic feeling, it's different from the red ball. The seam is very hard. It's bright, and quite big. The more you practice with it, the better you get,\" Siraj said.\"I think with the pink-ball, it's better to bowl back of length. Because pitching it up, there's not a lot of swing, so the more you hit the deck and get it to seam, it will be better for us,\" he noted.\"I have heard that the ball swings a lot under the lights but I haven't yet bowled with it under lights. So when we go to Adelaide and practice, we will try that. And the more practice we get, we'll know more about what we have to do.\"",

    "description1": "NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar has voiced his thoughts on the ongoing discussions surrounding the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, set to be hosted by Pakistan. In a recent video, Akhtar provided a balanced perspective, acknowledging both Pakistan's stance and the broader implications of the situation.\"You are getting paid for hosting rights and revenue, and that's fine—we all understand it. Pakistan's stance is also reasonable. They should have maintained a strong position—why not? Once we are able to host the Champions Trophy in our country and they are unwilling to come, they should share the revenue with us at a higher rate. That’s a good call,\" Akhtar remarked. &mdash; Rizzvi73 (@Rizzvi73) However, he emphasized the need for Pakistan to adopt a positive approach, particularly regarding their participation in future tournaments i",

I understand that the hybrid model had already been signed earlier,\" he added. 115356991Akhtar's comments come as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) recently agreed to a hybrid model for the Champions Trophy, where India's matches will be played in Dubai. While this compromise allowed Pakistan to retain hosting rights, the PCB has also presented demands to the ICC, including equal terms for hybrid models in future ICC tournaments held in India. PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi reiterated the need for a fair system, stating, “It shouldn’t be that we travel to India and they don’t come to our country.”",

    "description1": "Rohit Sharma got the first feel of Australian conditions in a match situation on the second day of the warm-up fixture against Australian Prime Minister's XI, when he returned to lead the side after missing the first Test in Perth.Rohit, who recently welcomed a baby boy to the family, was on paternity leave and joined the team only midway through the Perth Test. India lead the five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy series 1-0 and will next play a day-night pink-ball Test in Adelaide. The visitors warmed up for that with a 50-overs-a-side match under the lights after the first day of the practice match in Canberra was washed out by rain, and a moment caught on camera during the game forced the commentators to playfully remark: \"I don't know if he (Rohit) is crying or laughing.\"  115843776Rohit, who normally opens batting, decided to not disturb the pairing of KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal who got India off to a good start in the second i",

Rahul, who made 77 during that stand, looked good in the first innings as well before he was dismissed for 26.Rohit, thus, batted at number four on Sunday but could not find success as he was dismissed for 3 off 11 balls. India, however, won the match by six wickets.As the match continued even after India achieved the target of 241, so that other Indian batters could get some pink-ball practice, Sarfaraz Khan went out to bat at number eight but was dismissed after scoring just one run. It led to Rohit putting his hand on face in disappointment, much to the amusement of the TV commentators.

He scored just 91 runs in his six innings against the Kiwis and would hope to rediscover his form in Adelaide. ",

He acknowledges Bumrah's skills and reputation as one of the world's best bowlers. 115881551\"I was watching quite a bit. Bumrah is a skilful player, obviously, and probably the best in the world. Hopefully, one day I can face him and see how we go. I feel confident [in my game]. I’ve been training really hard and it’s a great opportunity to play against the best players,\" Konstas was quoted as saying by WA Today.Konstas's cricketing journey has progressed rapidly.",

His recent century has renewed discussions about his international prospects. Konstas's impressive performance against the visiting Indian team has certainly put him back in the spotlight.Konstas acknowledged the guidance received from former Australian captain Tim Paine during the match. Paine's advice focused on maintaining positive intent and applying pressure.\"I’ve been practicing it a little bit with Tim Paine, but yeah, good to get a few away. Tim just told us to have good intent and put pressure on them and treat it like a 46-over game. So I was just trying to keep things simple and just trying to stick to my plans,\" he said.Konstas implemented this advice effectively, contributing to a strong performance against a quality opponent. This approach allowed him to showcase his abilities under pressure.The century is a positive development for Australia. The team is seeking solutions to its top-order inconsistencies, and Konstas's performance provides a potential answer. 115846807",
