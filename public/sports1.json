    "description1": "In the final game between India and Australia of the Benson &amp; Hedges World Championship of Cricket at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, a local cricket fan was holding a banner titled: “Bus Conductors vs Taxi Drivers.” In 2020-21, India pacer Mohammed Siraj was called a “Brown Dog” and “Big Monkey” in a series of racist slurs hurled by a group of Australian spectators. To combat racism, Cricket Australia has come up with the Multicultural Action Plan, whose sole aim is to battle racism. “I think first and foremost, we have to acknowledge that racism still exists in society and hasn’t gone away. It’s still there. And it’s going to be there for some time, unfortunately,” Michael Napper, who has come up with Cricket Australia’s initiative to engage with multicultural audiences, tells The Indian Express from Melbourne. “We recognize that sport should be free of that. And it should just be a place where everyone can come and celebrate, feel welcome, and be part of that. So I’m really hopeful that we have moved beyond all those infamous incidents,” he says. Napper explains the roadmap that they have made to ensure that there is no place for racism in Australian cricket at any level. Be it grassroots or at the highest level and there would be steps that will ensure a due process is followed. “It’s very simple. If we can identify and know who has done an act like that, whatever that act might be, they would immediately be asked to leave. I’m saying that politely, they’ll be removed. And that will happen within the venue itself. They would then be part of… call it a legal process where we would look at a potential banning order. And so they can’t come to cricket going forward. If it happened in grassroots and playing cricket, it would be a similar thing, we would go through a tribunal process, there’d be an investigation. And likewise, if they were found to have made racist remarks or comments, there would be some sort of sanction, whether that be a ban, a fine or something like that. It’s something we are taking very seriously.\" Napper, who has been the driving force behind Cricket Australia’s plan to reach out to the sub-continent audience, explains why they want to tap the rapidly increasing South Asian population in Australia, and when they came up with the plan. “I think it probably started over the last, call it 10 years or so. There is a high level of migration that’s coming over. You know, within cricket, we’ve been seeing more and more South Asian heritage or ancestry or even people who were born in South Asia coming to our games, following cricket, and being part o",
    "description2": "f the Australian cricket family. So for us, it’s really about making sure that they feel included in everything we do. “When COVID hit really, and when we were redesigning our new strategic plan. So a key focus for us was, right, how can we better engage with the multicultural and South Asian audience within Australia to really make them feel part of the sport. And so that was where the Multicultural Action Plan came from,” he says. Cricket Australia has also tapped into the sub-continent students studying in universities across Australia. “We know the student population in Australia is massive, particularly in Melbourne. We have reached out to them, and you’ve seen the impact that had in the recent Pakistan game, the ODI that we had over at the MCG. That crowd was so young, so vibrant, making so much noise, a huge amount of that comes down to the work we’ve done in contacting universities. “We’ve got a WhatsApp group or a mailing list of 40,000 students now from a South Asian background. So yeah, spot on. It’s a key audience for us and someone who we want to continue connecting with, not just for international cricket, because obviously, you know, Pakistan or India might come once every few years. But we want to make sure that you’re also coming to the Big Bash and being part of Australian cricket. We want to make sure that they can enjoy cricket regardless of the year,” says Napper. “Potentially, we might end up with a sea of blue at certain Test matches this summer, where we’re seeing lots of Indian fans. And that could be contentious for some Australians. But we’re hoping that we’re going to have a really good festival and party atmosphere,” says Napper. There is also the very important aspect of educating immigrants about Australian culture. “And it’s a two-way thing. We actually are trying to do that in all forms to get right. So we know that if you’re attending games, it’s about understanding that, you know, Australian fans will typically visit the game with their friends, have fun, drink alcohol, and celebrate. And it’s much more of that more laid-back affair where you see it in the sun, you watch the game, and there’s that constant buzz. “Then you have the Indian fans coming in who want to bring instruments, they want to shout, they want to make noise, they want to have that festival-like atmosphere. And it’s making sure both of those things can coexist. And then similarly, when you’re talking about grassroots cricket, or you’re talking about watching cricket, it’s about making sure those cultures can all come together and enjoy it in a way that suits them.”",

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/IND-NETS-2.jpg",
    "description1": "“They told me it will be busy, but this busy, huh!” The elderly lady at the entrance of the Adelaide Oval says with a smile. Around her, utter chaotic joy prevails as at least 3,000 fans storm through just to see the Indian team practise. Dhol beats, cries of ‘jeetega bhai jeetega’, ‘Kohli Kohli’ and ‘Rohit Rohit’ ring in the air. It was an open session for fans to watch the Australian and Indian teams training. There were hardly any people to watch the Australians train in the afternoon but around 5 pm, they blew in like a storm to see the Indians, shocking the lady at the gate. Around 6 pm - the Indians had a long training session that started even before 5 pm and ended nearly three-and-a-half hours later - a group of at least 20 Australian schoolkids in uniform ran in to see them. There was no such group for the Australians training. They weren't kids of Indian origin either, such is the attraction of this Indian team Down Under. The official training was supposed to start at 5:30 pm local time, and it did, but two Indians were at nets an hour earlier: captain Rohit Sharma and Rishabh Pant, who hit the batting nets straightaway, before the crowd came in. Rohit’s training in particular was interesting.“Yaar, gaddha hai idhar! (There is a hole/dent)” he said about an area of the ground at the popping crease of the first net he went into bat. There are four nets at the Adelaide Oval, and he chose to carry on in that particular one as it didn’t upset his rhythm. The skipper stood carefully, his back leg cutting the popping crease line. The dent was particularly bad just behind the crease. Even as a support staff suggested rather naively that he could perhaps stand a touch ahead, Rohit replied, “arre! I want to stand here”. And so he stood, back leg on the crease line. His first movement was opening that front leg that pressed forward at an angle towards the bowler. Rohit has a rather visible twitch of both feet as the bowler is about to enter the delivery stride, his knees flexing, and the front foot opening out a touch. This was his main focus in the nets. He was seen discussing with assistant coach Abhishek Nayar if he was getting the stance and movement right. In his first stint, before the other players came, Rohit faced new shiny balls. Does that mean he might yet open the innings in the Adelaide Test or was it to just ensure that he face",
    "description2": "d deliveries that seamed a bit - as new balls tend to do. Once the rest of the team joined him at the batting nets after warm-up and catching practice, he faced old balls. Possible pointers In each of the four nets, two batsmen were together. If the pairings are anything to go by, Rohit was paired with Pant. One batsman facing a few balls, and another at the non-striker’s end. KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal; Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill; Rohit and Pant; Washington Sundar and Nitish Reddy. That indicates Jaiswal and Rahul as the openers, Gill and Kohli the no.3 and no.4 respectively and so on. But all that's speculation. Either way, suffice to say Indians practised long, hard, and rather intensely, with at least 3,000 people hollering around them. Incidentally, head coach Gautam Gambhir, who had gone to India after the Perth Test and missed the warm-up game in Canberra, was back and stood behind the stumps at one of the four nets. Arms crossed, face as intense as ever, he was almost motionless watching proceedings. Now and then, when Rohit was between his stints from one net to another, they would have a short chat, but for the main part, Gambhir stood there like a statue, observing everything quietly. Just like the statue of Clem Hill, who played in the early 1900s, that stands outside the arena, near the road across the river that shimmered in the afternoon sun. Inside though, the Indians, and for that matter Australians, were smashing the ball. Even Marnus Labuschagne, who has been under fire for batting without intent in the middle. At the nets in the afternoon, he was making an obvious effort to play shots. In Perth, he was trying to defend or leave- even in the nets – in Adelaide, he was more intent on hitting. The pink ball's effect on cricketers is rather fascinating. Never mind Labuschagne, who probably has his own poor form to overcome, the general feeling among batsmen about the pink ball is that it doesn’t do much under sun in the afternoon, but can unleash trickery under lights. And so, it's better to try and score as many runs as possible before it unleashes its devilry on them. The last word, however, goes to that security lady. “How many people turn up for nets for the Indians in your country?!” Oh, it’s not open to the public there. And she goes, “Makes sense, I can see 10,000 landing up. How will people like me manage, then?!”",

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/Gukesh-Liren-2.jpg",
    "description1": "For about five hours on Tuesday, world champion Ding Liren was scrambling. He ducked threats on the board. He evaded time trouble. He walked on the edge of traps that would have led to uncomfortable pins. For five hours — to reference the popular meme — Ding was not chilling. But eventually, Ding managed to salvage a draw out of a precarious situation in Game 7 after a 72-move defensive masterclass at the World Chess Championship to keep the contest at a level pegging. At 5 hours and 20 minutes, this was the longest game of the match so far between Ding and D Gukesh. The world champion’s troubles on the board started early. In the past six games, Ding has emerged as the better-drilled combatant, replying on opening prep to catch his teenage opponent off guard. On Tuesday, it was his turn to fight his way out of his opponent’s best-laid plans. Ding had just returned to his chair after a break in his private lounge when he spotted a novelty on the board from his young opponent in a line that is well known. Gukesh’s 7.Re1 (moving his rook sideways to the left by a square, rather than capturing the d5 pawn or advancing his b file pawn) was a move that caught the Chinese off guard. It took the champion 28 minutes to even fashion a response (7.dxc4, where Ding picked off an undefended pawn from Gukesh). “When I saw this move, I had just come back from the toilet. I was totally shocked. That’s why I spent a lot of time on my response,” said Ding. That was just the start of his troubles. At some stage in the middle game, Ding’s queen was trapped like a beached whale after making a daring breach past Gukesh’s defensive lines. For about 10 moves, it shuffled around, not doing much before finally a trade of queens put it out of its misery. Shortly afterwards, the bishops too got traded. On the move when Gukesh captured Ding’s queen, the engine later suggested that had Gukesh brought his bishop back (32.Bg5 instead of 32.Qxf5) and let Ding take his queen instead of the other way round, he could have had a significant advantage. “Before the queen exchange and even after it, I thought I should be winning the ga",
    "description2": "me,” said Gukesh. In the nick of time While trying to extricate himself out of trouble, Ding spent so much time on the clock that he played his 40th move — after which players get an additional 30 minutes on the clock — with just seven seconds left. That move was a huge blunder as well (instead of 40.Ke5 which he played, the world champion should have opted for 40.Nc8-b6 which would have earned him a chance to draw.) “I was beaten many times. Firstly in the opening. Then the middle game,” Ding admitted in the post-game press conference. “I thought I was totally inferior during the game. I was getting outplayed. But like many other times, maybe the position was not so bad. And I need to have more confidence in my moves. Today’s game was an absolute rollercoaster. I was satisfied that I was not knocked out and will live to fight another day.” Ding had been scrambling to not lose on time for the second time at the World Chess Championship after going down in similar circumstances in Game 3. Winning Tuesday’s game would have been strategically important, as it was the halfway mark of the world chess championship. After seven games, both players have 3.5 points each. For Gukesh, there were a few inaccuracies that allowed his grip on the game to slip. Two of those moves came close to each other: 44.Ke1 (where the computer suggested 44.Ra6) and 46.Bd1 (the computer's suggestion 46.Ke2). These two moves allowed Ding to cling on for a draw. While Gukesh realised he had missed his best shot at taking the lead in the best-of-14 game match, he was not too dejected that his opponent had pulled a draw out of thin air. “Today was a missed chance. Bit of a disappointment. But he also missed some chances earlier in the match. So it’s fair we’re here,” Gukesh said before pointing out the positives from Game 7, “Obviously outplaying him from the start. The most positive thing for today was that I felt good on the board.” For the Chinese world champion, it was a draw that was as good as a psychological win. “It was hard to believe. I made many mistakes. Fortunately, I saved the game,” said the Chinese GM with a smile.",

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/Cummins.jpg",
    "description1": "Early morning, a chat bubbles up at the central market, couple of kilometres from the Adelaide Oval cricket stadium. Established in the late 1800’s, it’s a large indoor market for fresh produce - vegetables, cheese, spices, fruits, cafes, and whatever else one can think of eating. The talk starts about weather as Friday, the opening day of the second Test, is supposedly set to see some rains. Archie, possibly in his 60’s, isn’t too happy. Not with the forecast but with the Australian team. “Don’t worry, even if two days gets washed out, this Australian team will lose in just three days. Too bloody soft. Too woke. And now they are in-fighting also.” And he is off poking at what seems a rather oversized cabbage. It’s not a random cabbage-loving fan that is talking on those terms. For a while now, Pat Cummins’s Australian team has been copping it amongst a certain section of fans, media, and even former cricketers. ‘Captain Woke’, 'UnAustralian', 'Too soft', 'Too friendly' and such. And this is a team that has won nearly everything under the sun: Test championship, ODI World Cup, T20 World Cup. The loss at Perth Test has already kicked up such talk again from the former cricketers and fans. Bizarrely, a stray comment from Josh Hazlewood - he said before the final day’s play at Perth that “it’s now upto the batters” - has been blown out of proportion. Media interpreted it as a hint to a full-scale divide in the team. Player after player have been forced to refute it in media interactions. But the damage has been done. Why is this Australian team not so loved at home but liked more outside the country? That question is posed to Greg Rowell, a Cricket Australia board member involved in strategising and a former first-class player who had taken Sachin Tendulkar’s wicket in a Prime Ministers XI game in 1991. Rowell takes a measured pause and corrects the question. “By a certain section of older fans and older former cricketers here,” he tell The Indian Express. “They are used to the old Australian way of playing. And what goes with it: the hard sledging, being not just tough but seen as being tough and there is a difference there, a touch abrasive to the opponents that’s defined as not giving a quarter to the other team. To be fair to that generation of cricketers, it was the way cricket was played here. Snarl more, less smiles, and reserve the nicer side after stumps. “It’s part of the Australian cricket identity. It comes from our past, the weather - we had to prove to the English in those years, the hot sun comes into it too, and it was how, not just international cricket, but first-class and backyard cricket too was played even between brothers. Cricketing fans outside the country might have misconstrued it because cricket perhaps in say India or West Indies was more fun, a sport - we Australians saw it a bit differently. I would say it was a cultural difference,” Rowell says. And now even as Australia is striving to be more diverse and if possible be inclusive in that diversity, Pat Cummins’ team probably should be poster boys of that brave new world. But they aren’t. “True. This team does play differently and I would say Australia as a cricketing country needed to. In the past, cricketers had gone a bit too far and alienated even some parts of the cricketing world,” Rowell says. He doesn’t mention the incidents but that straying too far was reflected in the sandpaper gate, too much unsavoury sledging, and a certain roughness about the teams. “We had to pull back and this team does it naturally, organically. Pat is really that sort of a guy.” Cummins in particular has copped a lot from many Australians for questioning the sponsorship of the Australian team by a coal-powered energy company Alinta. As it happenned Cricket Australia’s deal with them ended and even",
    "description2": " though the company said it was a move decided before Cummins’s statements; media and fans had piled on the Australian captain. “Climate catastrophist clown with far-left views,” screamed Sky News Australia and social media called him “Captain Woke”. Australia Advance, a far-right media, snarled in a piece, “Shut up Cummins, and focus on winning a few games”. It propped up again when Cummins and his team took the knee for ‘Black Lives Matter’. Not that he was flustered. “I don’t even know what Woke means. If anything some people would say it’s a good thing. It’s a label, means nothing. If anyone thinks it (taking knee for black lives matter) is a bad thing, then those five minutes out of our lives is the worst thing that can happen to them, we don’t care.” In Perth, the former cricketers went after the team for their “body language” on the second day’s play during India’s second innings. “This team plays as hard as any,” says Rowell. “They just do it differently, quietly, that’s all. Some of the Indian greats like Tendulkar or Dravid, they weren’t at opponent’s face all the time, were they?” A Australian player who has copped a bit for that “quietness” on the field is Alex Carey, the wicketkeeper. For a country that has seen dynamic glovesmen like Rod Marsh, the embodiment of the quintessential Aussie cricketer, doughty Ian Healy, the swashbuckling Adam Gilchrist, or even the eccentrics like Tim Zoehrer; Carey can come across as quiet as mouse behind the stumps. Or in his rather earnest schoolboyish image. Never mind that he was the man who ran out Jonny Bairstow, who had stepped out to gardening the pitch in an Ashes Test, his relationship with the irate section of Aussies hasn’t really warmed up. On Tuesday, he was asked what’s his relationship with the Australian fans. “I really don’t know. There were some who patted me and wished me luck here in Adelaide. I know I am not liked in England,” he says with a smile. “But I don’t know how to answer that question. I am just myself. The team knows me, I am not that sort of the guy (referring to whether he feels the need to chirp more from behind the stumps). So, I just cut out the external noise and do my thing. Iam just being myself.” That’s exactly what Cummins has been trying: to make his players be themselves. If that means the vegan Adam Zampa is uncomfortable about being a face for KFC or if someone in the team has an opinion about climate change. A soft team wouldn’t have done what Carey did to run out Bairstow, a soft leader won’t have the courage to bowl first in a World cup final in Ahmedabad. Australians of the past used to impose their ego on the opponents. Australians, under Cummins, try to use the ego of the opponents, sucking them into mistakes. “This is a smart team which has won so many titles, but I fear the old generation of players, and perhaps fans from that era, might not warm up to this team,” Rowell says. “But as I said the teams had overstepped in the past. We had to pull back. And this team does it. This Australian team is more loved around the cricketing world, and that’s important. Australianism is not a fixed concept. It keeps changing. The world is changing. The older Australian cricketers who have a problem with the team would hopefully realise it.” Considering they haven’t even when this Australian team has been winning everything, it does seem rather optimist. But to leave the definitions of Australianism or the Australian way to an older section of people, be it fans or cricketers, is not ideal. Cummins knows it as he once put pithily, “What is this supposed Australian way, I don’t know”. The problem is that the cabbage-hunter in the old Adelaide market thinks he knows it, and so this tussle between the new and old is likely to continue in this sun-burnt country for a while yet.",

The 18-year-old in front of the world champion has not noticed Ding’s furtive looks. He is in a meditative trance with his eyes shut. It’s become something of a tic for the boy from Chennai on the board. Each time he finds himself on the board with his opponent’s clock running, he tends to shut his eyes and calculate. “I’m in a room where there’s nothing else to see. So I close my eyes,” Gukesh had said after the previous game. “I close my eyes quite often during games. Sometimes, it is just that it’s easier to calculate with your eyes closed. So mostly just thinking about the position.” A couple of games back, the FIDE broadcast started calculating how much time Gukesh spends with his eyes shut on the board and how much time the players are spending away from their playing chairs. Grandmaster David Howell, a regular in the commentary booth, informed that this data is collected using Artificial Intelligence. Just then, Ding steals another glance at his zen-like opponent.

    "description2": "ess Championship use AI to calculate how much time Ding has spent eyeing his opponent. “In the first game (of the world championship), the better Ding’s position was, the more often he started to stare at Gukesh. That was my impression. Sometimes, you just do it without thinking. Other times we do it on purpose,” she said with a glint in her eye. When asked if there were other tricks grandmasters use to psych out their opponents, she said: “When I was a kid, there were many tricks. Looking at one part of the board and pretending that the most important thing is happening there. But creating a threat on the other side.” Pre-game rituals In the middle of Game 1, the Chess24 broadcast pointed out that Gukesh had spent some part of the morning solving puzzles on the chess.com app with a feature called Puzzle Rush. Apparently, the 18-year-old had hit a score of 53 in the three-minute puzzle rush in the morning, just short of his record of 58. Gukesh was asked if he had a specific pre-game routine and if he had any rituals. “Not much. I just try to follow a specific routine. Puzzle Rush is always nice to do to warm up my mind,” said Gukesh. Ding is then asked if he has any pre-game routines. “I get up. I shower. I then have some coffee,” he grins awkwardly.",

    "description1": "\n\n\nWellington [New Zealand], December 4 (ANI): Ahead of the second Test match against New Zealand, England bowling all-rounder Chris Woakes while reflecting on opener Zak Crawley's recent Test performance said that everyone has seen the quality the 26-year-old has.\nEarlier in the first Test in Christchurch, England clinched an eight-wicket win which helped them to take a 1-0 lead in the Test series against the Kiwis.\n\nCrawley made his Test debut in 2019 against New Zealand, following that, he has played 51 long format matches and scored 2848 runs at a strike rate of 65.47 and an average of 31.3.\nIn the Christchurch Test, the 26-year-old displayed a sluggish performance. In the first innings he was dismissed for a 12-ball duck and in the second innings, the English opener scored just one run from eight balls.\nSpeaking ahead of the second match, Woakes said that most of the time stats that come out are pure coincidence.\n\"A lot of the time I think these stats that come out are pure coincidence. I don't think it's anything to do with anything. New Zealand have some very good opening bowlers. He faces the new ball when they are their freshest and best, so he's probably got some good balls in there,\" Woakes was quoted by ESPNcricinfo as saying.\n\n\nThe bowling all-rounder talked about Crawley's opening role in the batting lineup and said that it's a tough job.\n\"We've seen the quality Zak has",
    "description2": ". Opening the batting is such a difficult job to do, that you will have occasions where you get low scores. We've seen what Zak can do. When he gets in, he's one of the worst batters to be bowling at in international cricket. I'm sure that will change,\" he added.\nRecapping the first Test match, Jacob Bethell's debut fifty and Brydon Carse's dominance with the ball helped England secure an eight-wicket victory over New Zealand at Hagley Oval in Christchurch.\nNew Zealand started Day 04 at 155/6 at Hagley Oval, with a four-run lead against England. The Kiwis added 99 runs to their overnight total. Daryl Mitchell (84) displayed a stunning performance with the bat and had support from Nathan Smith (21) and other tailenders on the way.\nHowever, Brydon Carse, who picked three of the four remaining wickets helping himself to career-best figures of 6/42, ensured that England had to chase only 104 to secure a win in the Christchurch Test.\nThe chase wasn't a problem for the Three Lions as New Zealand bowling failed to create any threat on the fourth day at Hagley Oval. Jacob Bethell led the English batting lineup during the chase and slammed a scintillating unbeaten fifty on his debut, with just 37 balls.\nEngland Playing XI for 2nd Test: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Jacob Bethell, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ollie Pope (WK), Ben Stokes (C), Chris Woakes, Gus Atkinson, Brydon Carse, Shoaib Bashir.

    "description1": "\n\n\nMelbourne [Australia], December 4 (ANI): Former England captain Michael Vaughan said that the Australian team lacked aggression during their loss to a \"dangerous\" India at Perth during the first Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test and their batting is nowhere near what it used to be during their peak years.\nAs Australia prepares for the second Test at Adelaide Oval, a pink-ball, day-night affair, they would no doubt be bothered heavily by the 295-run loss that transpired at Perth. The star-studded, glorious Australian batting line-up was exposed big time, especially Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne.\n\nAlso, the centuries by Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli were among many batting highlights in the second innings that left Aussie players exhausted mentally and physically by the time they stepped on the pitch to chase a gigantic 534 runs.\nVaughan, who had the experience of competing against legends like Ricky Ponting, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee, Adam Gilchrist etc during his playing days during the fiercely-contested Ashes series, noted that India gets extremely dangerous once they start feeling confident and it was visible in Perth as their body language and playing style was aggressive and in-your-face. On the other hand, Australia just looked like a \"nice team to play against.\"\n\"India are a very dangerous side, particularly when they start to get confidence and I think we saw that in Perth,\" Vaughan told SEN.\n\"They have got that energy and that aggressive nature, and that is the one thing that surprised me in Perth. I know India was on top, but India looked like a more aggressive team and a little bit more in-your-face in terms of playing cricket the way that Australia used to play.\"\n\"Australia just looked like a team that was just going - not through the motions - but they just looked like a nice team to play against.\"\n\"I did not see any aggression. I did not see the bouncer theory coming to Yashasvi Jaiswal. I did not see any kind of confrontation out in the middle,\" he concluded.\nVaughan also said that maybe the Aussies missed out on the presence of retired batter David Warner, who brought a lot of energy and aggression through both his batting and on-field confrontations, sledging and banter.\n\n\nThe former England captain also said that it is Australian batting which is letting them down m",
    "description2": "ore as compared to their bowling as the Pat Cummins-led quartet of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Nathan Lyon still can get top sides bowled out.\n\"I think the bowling attack is without any question that quartet of bowlers are up there with the best, but the batting is nowhere near,\" Vaughan said.\n\"I think that is where teams can really target this Australian batting lineup. If you can bowl them out quickly, which India did in that first Test, the bowlers have to go back out there and bowl a little bit too soon because they've not had the rest.\n\"The only way that Australia can put it right is by winning, and that is very simple terms. The batters can only put it right by putting a number on the board, your job as a bat is to score runs, your currency is runs. But it would not be easy,\" he concluded.\nVaughan could very well be right in his observation, with Mitchell Marsh (44.61) and Usman Khawaja (38.20) being the only batters averaging in late 30s or 40s since the team's ICC World Test Championship title win against India last year. Premier batters like Smith (32.82), Labuschagne (27.41) and Travis Head (30.45) have been facing a lean patch.\nThe Adelaide Test, starting on December 6, sees India entering with both a mental and physical edge, following a dominant performance in the first Test led by Jasprit Bumrah's bowling and captaincy.\nHowever, the visitors will also aim to exorcise the memories of the infamous 2020 Adelaide pink-ball Test, where they were dismissed for their lowest Test score of 36 runs. On that occasion, Pat Cummins (4/21) and Josh Hazlewood (5/8) dismantled the Indian batting line-up, giving Australia a straightforward target of 90 runs to chase.\nAustralia squad (for second Test): Pat Cummins (c), Scott Boland, Alex Carey (wk), Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitch Marsh, Nathan McSweeney, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster\nIndia squad: Rohit Sharma (C), Jasprit Bumrah (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Devdutt Padikkal, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar.\n\nReserves: Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini, Khaleel Ahmed, Yash Dayal.

    "description1": "\n\n\nAdelaide [Australia], December 4 (ANI): Ahead of the pink-ball Adelaide Test between India and Australia in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Damian Hough, the head curator of the pitch at the venue, said that six millimetres of grass will be used on the pitch.\nThe Adelaide Test, starting on December 6, sees India entering with both a mental and physical edge, following a dominant performance in the first Test led by Jasprit Bumrah's bowling and captaincy.\n\nHowever, the visitors will also aim to exorcise the memories of the infamous 2020 Adelaide pink-ball Test, where they were dismissed for their lowest Test score of 36 runs. On that occasion, Pat Cummins (4/21) and Josh Hazlewood (5/8) dismantled the Indian batting line-up, giving Australia a straightforward target of 90 runs to chase.\nSpeaking at the pre-match press conference about the pitch and grass cover, Hough said, \"Everything seems to stay the same. So it is of course matter grass, even grass cover, good deep moisture, but dry and hard. So something where the quicks will get a bit out of it, spinners will be able to get some bite and turn and bounce. But also important for us to get some partnerships in the players and the players to be able to play their shots. Should be around six. Right now we are at seven, but I reckon it will be six millimetres.\"\nHough said that though the ground staff is trying to produce a pitch that could offer a fine contest between bat and ball, it could get hard to bat under the lights with the new ball, especially with both teams having quality bowling attacks.\nOn the possibility of pitch changing with progress of the match like it changed from challenging to easy-to-",
    "description2": "bat on during the Perth Test, Hough said that while he cannot predict the pitch will change, one always wants pitches to change in Test cricket.\nHe also said that the pitch in Adelaide should be able to do enough with the new ball for pacers and spinners alike, but also aid batters once the ball gets older.\n\n\n\"Do you want it to change? Of course you do. Test matches should see it change throughout the course of the four or five days. Drop-in pitches are a bit more challenging.\"\n\"There is no doubt about that because they (drop-in pitches) hold together so well. Traditionally in Adelaide, it should do enough with the new ball for the whole game and it still should grip into that grass and bounce and spin for the whole game. But as the ball gets older, hopefully, the players or the batters can build partnerships and score some runs,\" he added.\nIndia are currently 1-0 up in the BGT series following their record-shattering 295-run victory in Perth. The second Test will be played in a day-night format in Adelaide, beginning from Friday.\nAustralia squad (for second Test): Pat Cummins (c), Scott Boland, Alex Carey (wk), Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitch Marsh, Nathan McSweeney, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster\nIndia squad: Rohit Sharma (C), Jasprit Bumrah (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Devdutt Padikkal, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar.\n\nReserves: Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini, Khaleel Ahmed, Yash Dayal.

    "description1": "\n\n\nChristchurch [New Zealand], December 4 (ANI): England Test captain Ben Stokes hit back at the International Cricket Council (ICC) following a slow-over-rate penalty on his team after the first Test against New Zealand at Christchurch, claiming that the match was finished with \"10 hours of play still left\".\nThe race to the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) final gained a lot of spice and intensity as New Zealand and England were docked three points each for maintaining a slow over-rate in the opening Test of their three-match series.\n\nOn Tuesday, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced sanctions against New Zealand and England for failing to maintain the required over-rate during the series opener in Christchurch.\nAs a result, both teams were fined 15 per cent of their match fees and penalised three crucial WTC competition points, adding another layer of intrigue to the race for the final.\nTaking to Instagram, Stokes said, \"Good on you ICC (accompanied by three shrugging emojis). \"Finished the game with 10 hours of play still left.\"\n\n\n\nThe ICC stated, \"New Zealand and England were both found to be three overs short of the target after time all",
    "description2": "owances were taken into consideration, with sides penalised one point for each over they were found short.\"\nEngland skipper Stokes and New Zealand captain Tom Latham accepted the charges and the proposed sanctions, negating the need for a formal hearing.\nThe charges were levelled by on-field umpires Ahsan Raza and Rod Tucker, third umpire Adrian Holdstock, and fourth official Kim Cotton, while the sanctions were imposed by David Boon of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees.\nEngland, already out of contention for next year's final, secured an 8-wicket victory in Christchurch. They are currently in the sixth spot with 10 wins, nine losses and a draw in 20 Tests, translating to a PCT of 42.50.\nHowever, the sanctions dealt a significant blow to New Zealand's chances. The inaugural WTC champions dropped from the joint fourth spot to fifth in the standings.\nFollowing the penalty, New Zealand's points percentage stands at 47.92 per cent. Even if they win their remaining two Tests against England, their best possible finish is a points percentage of 55.36 per cent. Their fate in reaching the WTC final will depend on the outcomes of other matches. (ANI)\n",

    "description1": "NEW DELHI: Comparing Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar, and Virat Kohli is like comparing legends from three distinct eras of cricket. Each has left an indelible mark on the game in their unique way. Sunil Gavaskar played at a time when the format of Test cricket was predominant and ODIs were limited. Gavaskar's mastery against fast bowling in an era without helmets, exceptional technique, and consistency is stuff of legends.Gavaskar was the first player to score 10,000 runs in Test cricket and he retired with 34 Test centuries to his name, a world record at that time. Gavaskar played a pivotal role in earning respect for Indian cricket in the 1970s and '80s and was the bedrock of India's batting during a time when pitches were bowler-friendly, and helmets were unheard of. His performances against the fearsome West Indies pace attack were iconic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpYwFih2sQ0Sachin Tendulkar excelled in both Tests and ODIs; saw the advent of T20 cricket. Tendulkar's versatility, adaptability, and unmatched ability to dominate bowlers across conditions and formats made him one of the greatest batsmen to play the game.Tendulkar retired with most runs in both Tests and ODIs and became the first cricketer to get to 100 international hundreds and was also a key player in India's 2011 World Cup victory.Tendulkar became the face of Indian cricket during the 1990s and early 2000s, inspiring an entire generation. He was revered for his consistency and longevity in a highly demanding cricketing landscape.Virat Kohli has excelled in all three formats: Tests, ODIs, and T20Is. Known as the chase master, Kohli's aggressive mindset, and ability to adapt to the modern demands of fitness and power cricket make him a modern-day great.With over 25",
    "description2": ",000 international runs across formats, most centuries in ODI chases, Kohli revitalized India's Test cricket ethos with aggressive leadership and redefined modern cricket standards with his fitness and intensity. Under Kohli's captaincy, India became a dominant Test side. His dominance in limited-overs formats, particularly in chasing, is unparalleled.And now a video is viral on which Gavaskar is asked during a talk show who was better Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli or him (Gavaskar).Gavaskar replies after pausing for a moment, \"I think everybody was very good, but I think Gary Sobers was the best.\"With a puzzled look and a smile, the co-host who had asked the question says, \"Yeah I'm glad, but I didn't give him that as an option.\"Gavaskar adds, \"Yeah, I know that, that's where the dry comes in.\"Another co-host chips in light-heartedly, \"Don't get frustrated with the guest on Drip Tray. He gave you his answer and that's his answer.\"The first co-host adds, \"Well, I'm not coming to dinner now.\" And his reply even invokes a beaming smile from Gavaskar.&mdash; thefrontbar7 (@thefrontbar7) For the record, Sir Garfield Sobers is often regarded as the greatest all-rounder in cricket history, who transcended his era with his incredible versatility and match-winning ability. Sobers scored 26 Test centuries, including a then-world record unbeaten 365 against Pakistan in 1958, which remained unbeaten for 36 years.Sobers was the ultimate all-rounder, equally adept at winning matches with bat, ball, or in the field and in 1968, became the first cricketer to hit six sixes in an over in a first-class match, playing for Nottinghamshire.Sobers was one of the first truly global cricketing superstars, admired for his sportsmanship and grace on and off the field.",

The new ball does a lot. So you need to respect the first 20-25 overs and try to soak in the pressure, try and get used to the pace or whatever the wicket is doing...If you get through that period, then, like I said, batting seems pretty normal to wherever you are in the world. So it's about managing those first 20-25 overs,\" he said.  115931965Rahul's 103 runs in his two innings at Perth came off 250 balls, which reminded of the job Cheteshwar Pujara did during India's back-to-back Test triumphs in Australia on the last two tours.\"I've played in different conditions; and when you do well in different conditions -- pace-friendly conditions or away from home, you do get a little bit of confidence and you do understand how you need to do it, and you repeat those processes again and again.\"Those are the things, those are the key points that you need to really work on -- playing the ball late, leaving a lot of balls and waiting for the bowlers to come to you.\"",

Of the 22 Tests that have been staged in its D/N avatar, Australia have featured in 12, all at home, and have lost only once to the West Indies at the Gabba.India, on the contrary, have played just four pink ball games, winning three (Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Bengaluru) and losing one.Yeah, THAT 36 one. Right here. Saturday, December 19, 2020.4,9,2,0,4,0,8,4,0,4,1.No, that isn't a cheat code. It was what every Indian batter contributed in the second innings as every false shot or mistake eerily produced a nick and every nick was pouched. And it happened in glorious batting conditions with the sun shining in all its glory.That's what the pink ball creates. It allows doubts and fears to nestle rent free in the minds and hearts of batters. Especially in the twilight zone. The ball behaves differently once the lights come on and the sun starts setting.

    "description2": "ith the tendency of the ball skidding on, thanks to the added lacquer, batters' footwork gets tested and any delay in reaction time often triggers his downfall.Australia have ruled in pink ball Tests because of their extraordinary cartel of pacers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR9AuAfHhrcAt Adelaide, where the pitch quickens up after Day One, thanks to the curators leaving an extra bit of grass to allow the lacquer on the ball to stay longer to aid its sighting, the pacers have had it good.A one hundred and seventy-three wickets taken by pace bowlers have come at a frugal 27.19. Correspondingly, spinners have taken 47 scalps at 39.72 with office Nathan Lyon, who had toiled as a groundsman at Adelaide, taking 28 of them.While India expertly negotiated the threat of slingy left-armer Mitchell Starc in Perth, with centurion Yashasvi Jaiswal even taunting him by saying, \"It's coming too slow\", they will know that the pink-ball Test in Adelaide is Starc's domain and poking the bear any further would be a misadventure.Mercurial and moody, Starc often has outhouse or penthouse figures. But his lengths in Adelaide generally are fuller and he has 39 wickets in seven Tests to show for his efforts. Those scalps have come at an obscene 16.64. A wicket for him happens every 35.5 balls here, 13 balls fewer than his career strike rate of 48.8.Apart from Starc's potency, what will also draw India's attention is the catching. On Day Two, in the 2020 Adelaide Test, a triple digit lead seemed a certainty, but routine drops from Bumrah, Mayank Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw, possibly the result of not sighting the ball properly, saw it reduced to 53 as the last three wickets added 80.Bumrah, a brutal self-appraiser, would also know that he and Umesh Yadav bowled a metre short in their first spells four years ago, allowing the openers a few sighters. Now, far more mature and scheming, expect him to course correct and also mentor his younger colleagues to target the stumps. That's where the wickets will come, especially against an Australian Top Four that seems chronically out-of-form and in awe of India's bowling talisman.",

    "description1": "Australia suffered a huge blow when Josh Hazlewood was ruled out of the pink-ball Test against India in Adelaide, which put the focus on right-arm pacer Scott Boland to replace him for the second Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy. But India got a good look at Boland with the pink ball in the warm-up fixture at Canberra, which many in Australia believe has put India at an advantage.Boland was named in the Australian Prime Minister's XI squad well before Hazlewood's side strain made him unavailable for the day-night Test in Adelaide. But cricket experts and the Aussie media believe that Cricket Australia could have withdrawn him and not let India warm-up against the 35-year-old seamer. https://www.youtube.com/live/OpZ5li1qO-g?si=OxnvMjNPAgxryrwNAustralian journalist Tom Morris questioned if the CA selectors have done the \"right thing\".

    "description1": "Josh Hazlewood, the Australian fast bowler, significantly impacted India's batting performance during the day-night pink ball Test match in Adelaide. India was bowled out for a mere 36 runs in their second innings.No Indian batter managed to reach double figures. Despite holding a 53-run lead after the first innings, India couldn't capitalize, allowing Australia to chase down the target of 90 runs and secure victory in the first Test of the 2022 Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Hazlewood reflected on the match, describing the challenging conditions for bowlers in the second innings. He emphasized the difficulty of balancing attacking for wickets while preventing runs when the opposing team has a lead.&mdash; cricketcomau (@cricketcomau) “They were a couple of wickets down overnight, and I don’t think I bowled that night. Then we came back the next day—it’s the toughest time to bowl when you’re in the second innings, and they’ve got a lead, so you’re trying to attack and take wickets while not leaking runs. It’s a tough little period of bowling, so I guess things just fell into place that way.” Josh Hazlewood told circket.com.au.He attributed the success to hitting the right length consistently, resulting in a series of edges. He also acknowledged the early wickets taken by his teammates, which further pressured the Indian batsmen.115931965“I remember coming on as the first change. They just kept nicking everything; I didn’t really plan it. It was my first ball, and I was just trying to hit the length. We were off to a good start—they wer",
    "description2": "e 3 for 15—so I was trying to apply the pressure and keep it going, not trying to do anything fancy, just hitting the line and length. Luckily, I got the nick first up.”“Rahane was a pretty big wicket in that series, particularly in Australia. He’s a good player. It was the fifth ball of the first over, so I wasn’t trying to do anything special—just sticking to line and length. The pink ball was doing enough on its own. They were probably hesitant, being 4 for 20 at that stage.” he added.Hazlewood described Wriddhiman Saha's wicket as fortunate, caught at square leg off a flick. He recognized that Saha was likely playing cautiously given the precarious situation of the Indian innings.He then recalled his 200th Test wicket, that of Ravichandran Ashwin, caught behind off a faint edge.“It wasn’t a big nick (of R Ashwin), but there was definitely a noise, and the bat was there. That was my 200th wicket—a very fine nick. I guess I was on a hat-trick, so I probably celebrated that one a bit more.”Hazlewood emphasized the importance of dismissing the recognised batter when the tail is exposed. “It was the sort of situation where a batter was batting with the tail. At this stage, even though they had only scored 80-odd runs, if the recognised batter gets on a roll with the strike, the innings can drag out. So, it’s always good to get the established batter out and leave two tail-enders together.”Hazlewood concluded by expressing his satisfaction with the events in Adelaide, highlighting the positive memories he retained from the match.",

    "description1": "India's first training session under lights is an occasion to savour but important decisions await team ahead of crucial second TestADELAIDE: The delayed red-eye flight to Adelaide seemed in limbo on its Singapore tarmac. The snaking queues had long passed their state of agitation and quieted down to uneasy repose when the momentary sighting of Gautam Gambhir made heads turn.Border-Gavaskar TrophyIndia's coach was heading back to the scene of the action in Australia after a brief visit back home. Glances met, pleasantries exchanged and brief handshakes later, he retreated into his own world, down the vast corridors of one of the world's busiest airports, but not before sending everyone's cricketing pulse racing.A few hours later and into the next day, in another continent, Gambhir stood quietly, first in the background and then in the second pacers' nets, as India's batters hit the ground running ahead of the crucial second Test against Australia. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeRP6n8C-0Only, this wasn't an ordinary nets session. Heaving hordes tumbled in to catch a glimpse of their stars in action at a rare arm's length. Adelaide, the city of vibrant colours, seemed tickled pink by the presence of India's star cricketers.It was a goodwill gesture, an open nets session to stimulate interest, but the practice session turned into concert-level frenzy. Security had to be called in at times to clear restricted areas. A thousand selfies were clicked. Excited teenagers called up friends asking them to rush over. Beating drums rent the air, and, of course, Virat Kohli soaked in all the hero worship.\"Sab mazey le rahey hai (Everyone's having fun),\" Rishabh Pant told Rohit Sharma in the adjacent nets at one point after having a rather hard time coping with Jasprit Bumrah, Akash Deep, Mohammed Siraj and Harshit Rana breathing fire with the pink ball. Rohit himself warned Abhishek Nayar at one point to not talk tactics in such a public view after explaining some front-foot trigger movements to the assistant coach.Every block was cheered, every hit elicited a roar. Every victory for the bowler was celebrated. This was training as spectacle, nets as performance art. Such is the level of frenzy the Indian team arouses away from home that Australia's own open training session a couple of hours earlier seemed tepid in comparison, apart from minor ",
    "description2": "injury scares to their struggling star batters Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_s_BIWcH_YEven without all the attention and cheery chaos, this would have been an important session, the team's first with the pink ball in moist twilight conditions, that dreaded time when the lacquer-coated, fancy-coloured orb wobbles unpredictably to raise the fear of leaving batting collapses in its wake.In Adelaide, where Australia have never lost a pink-ball Test, the surface tends to add fuel to the pink fire. No wonder India's batters want more time out in the nets to size up the challenge. The first Test of the 2020-21 series saw them collapse to their lowest-ever Test score of 36 in the second innings, but it's unlikely that the sour taste lingers, especially since India came back to win that series. This time it's about consolidating the advantage after the remarkable comeback win in Perth.Questions still linger about the team's opening plans, and no doubt these will gain ground over the next few days. On Tuesday evening, Rohit Sharma and Rishabh Pant took first strike, even before the warm-ups. When nets resumed, though, Perth openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul began proceedings, and Rohit and Pant again batted in tandem. India's captain may not be averse to batting in the middle order for the first time since 2019, but time - and conditions - will tell.Also on Tuesday, Australia's wicketkeeper Alex Carey took great pains to point out why the pink ball is so tough to spot, saying, \"At times when the lights come on, it can be a little bit of a depth perception. You have to watch the ball as closely as possible, adapt as quickly as possible. At times from behind the stumps, it (the ball) can seem to have a bit of a (pink) glow... sort of a tail. They have a comet tail.\"Given the weird patterns of pink-ball Tests and the increasing uncertainty in players' minds, it may be fair to term it a format all on its own, another oddity in modern cricket's blend of styles. Here at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday, though, the practicality of pink Tests didn't seem to matter. Nothing did. The only star trails were left by India's cricketers.Will the festive air last if the team doesn't do well starting Friday? Gambhir, standing quietly in the corner, seemingly unmoved by all the noise, may have been thinking the same thing.",

    "description1": "Benafsha Hashimi is sitting on her father’s lap, stroking his beard, in Kabul, Afghanistan when an advisory message plays out on the television. “Don't come to Australia illegally on boats”, a note for the many immigrant residents risking, often losing, their lives to get across. Little Benafsha thinks Australia is just on the other side of the big river in Kabul. “I shall go there, pedar (Father, in Dari language) one day, I have to just cross the river”. The father tells her she has to learn swimming first. “Don’t worry, I can go in a boat!” The father laughs but assures her that she can go the proper way one day but she has to study hard and grow up. Nearly one-and-half decades later, in 2021, the 21 year old Hashimi has ended up in Canberra in Australia, escaping the clutches of Taliban, surviving the death of her father, an Afghan special forces soldier, in mysterious circumstances. But she also witnessed an aunt who bled to death, besides myriad shootings, before dragging her entire Afghan team of women along with her. All this when she was still a teenager, three years back. It’s a remarkable story of hope, will-power, selflessness, stubbornness, and a lot of cheekiness. We meet at an outdoorsy cafe the morning after India’s warm-up game against the Prime Minister’s XI. Almost immediately, she excuses herself and hops off to play with a dog that was barking rather loudly and she laughs, a lovely full-throated aural memory that will stick in the mind, when the dog’s owner says ‘he likes his own voice’. When she plonks back on her chair, she announces, “I have a cat, Lilly. I love lilies and my Lilly. We talk a lot.” It’s probably the rare imagery of the morning when she reflects her age; the rest of the time, as she narrates her life story, immense inspiring maturity floats in the air. It’s a story that’s difficult to decide where to start. At that moment, perhaps, when the Taliban had taken over the city, the 18-year old rushes to the bank to withdraw money for her family of 10 but instead hears the Taliban soldiers outside the bank, firing in the air. Or at the Checkpost at Pakistan border, when she is fleeing with the family in the middle of night 'sadly like a pack of thieves” and is stopped by the Talibs, who bark at her brother Hamid to tell “this girl to stop talking, who has given a girl rights to talk, just stand aside.” Or the moment when her phone starts to ring, with a popular Farsi love song triggering outrage in the Taliban soldiers, and her brother muttering, ‘we are all going to die’ even as he tried to stop the call. It was her friend, a cricketing team-mate wanting to know her whereabouts. It’s perhaps best to start with why that friend was reaching out. Not at that moment, but how Benafsha became the rallying group leader for the girls of her cricket team, and their families, to get to Australia in a move that’s bound to have positive repercussions for generations to come for those families. “No, no, it was a combined team effort, I couldn’t have done it without my friends,” she says but it’s clear that they couldn’t have even dared to dream this life without her. She was the resourceful one, tirelessly pursuing opportunities outside, sending emails to all parts of the cricketing world and beyond to see a possible light at the end of the Taliban tunnel. The first three emails were her passport to survival and better life but unbelievably she chose to ignore them. The US authorities offered her escape due to her father’s past with them, Canada threw her a lifeline and so did Dubai, but she is adamant that she wants her team with her. “My well-wishers who were trying to help me to escape all understandably called me an idiot. But I was stubborn. In weak moments when I would think perhaps I should take it, an inner voice would come loud and clear: ‘C’mon Benafsha, you are a team player. This is not what a good person does. You can’t abandon your friends and be selfish.” And so she even lies to her mother that she didn’t hear back from anyone. That they have to just wait and hope. It’s when Mel Jones, an Australian woman cricketer of stature hears her story, and offers help. The Australian authorities get into the picture soon and are shocked to hear that she wants the entire team and families to escape. “You know, right, we can’t do that. It’s not easy, how can we take so many people out. You and your family come first.” Benafasha Hashimi listens to no one but her inner voice. “Even today when I speak to youngsters I tell them, my life motto is, “Listen to all, but don’t follow anyone. Only follow your heart, courage will come automatically.” Around us, the dog is now barking at a distance as the owners have just left, the sun is shining brightly, and the cafe lady offers coffee; Benafsha doesn’t want any. “That dog is funny. I haven’t heard any other dog in this city bark as loudly as him. It’s not like Kabul, you know,” she says. Or India. But we plunge back to Kabul, before we can return to her escape, and to her father. “He treated me like a little princess. Usually Afghan men prefer sons; he was different, distributing laddoos to everyone in the neighbourhood when I was born, his fourth child. He would keep telling me that I am a special one and can do whatever I want, live my dream but only that I have to be educated and work hard.” Due to the nature of his work, he was often away. “And then one day, he came in a coffin. There he was laid out, outside our door and I was not even 10 then. I just sat there, staring at him. My younger sister kept repeating, “he is just sleeping, he will wake up.” It was their mother who took both aside to tell them that their father is no more and it’s okay to cry. “Don’t bottle it up, cry if you have to. This is what it is. We have to face reality.” The reality kept turning dark. “Some said he had a heart-attack, some said he was poisoned, we don’t know to this day.” Not long after that, more tragedy struck. Benafsha found herself pouring water on her aunt’s dea",
    "description2": "d body to cleanse. “Only women are allowed in our tradition. She was shot in the hip and head, blood on her body when she was brought home.” A childhood shot to pieces, pushing her to grow up rather too quickly but luckily one remnant would remain. “Cricket saved my life,” she says with a chirpiness, and adding solemnly, “Cricket is my life.” *** Her mother never liked her playing cricket. Especially in the streets with the boys, once she grew up a little. The coaches at the official academy didn’t take a liking to her because she was a “street cricketer” and not someone who grew up in the system. Her memories of playing in the streets still remain very special to her. “The empty oil tin cans were our stumps and I must say I terrorised the boys by hitting!” It was her eldest brother Hamid who kept fighting with their mother to allow her to play cricket and things turned a bit when she won a scholarship to a cricket talent programme. Things kept escalating positively and she was named alongside 25 girls, officially contracted by the Afghanistan Cricket board in 2021. The lights would go out soon, though. She remembers that day at the bank just days after the Taliban took over. “When I heard the shootings I froze in fear. I huddled behind other women, not knowing what would happen.” But it wasn’t the bullets that was her worst moment, but the vulgar gaze of a male Taliban soldier. “He gave me this look - a dirty look that I can’t describe but I knew what it was. He told the others to stop shooting and told me that the bank is shut today, but write your name now in this paper. And come to meet me tomorrow. I shall take you inside. I nodded and ran from there, shivering. That look is my worst memory from those days at Kabul. It made me doubly determined that I should leave Afghanistan. There was no option left.” But as we know even when the opportunities came, she didn’t take them as she wanted her team also to be safe. “I am the one doing all the paperwork, emailing, talking in my broken English; what would happen to them if I left?” And so she pressed the Australian authorities to somehow pull off the miracle for her. They buckled under her sweet emotional pressure, and promised her they would. That they will process the paperwork, get the required permission, but the evacuation can’t be en-masse. First her and her family. “I managed to get two more families along with me, of course,” she smiles. And it’s to that night in September 2021 she returns to. “Many in our group were happy, but me and my sister Safia, who is two years younger and also in our team, were sad. We love Afghanistan, we loved our days in Kabul. We didn’t want to leave …” There were numerous checkpoints, where they would all insist that they were off to a wedding. It was at one such post where her phone rang with Farsi love tune drifting in the air. “The talibs were so angry, screaming that it’s blasphemy and that we shall be whiplashed. Somehow we got through.” They were in Pakistan, first, for a week before they flew to Australia. They say it takes a village to rear a child, it takes people from different countries to flee that village in distress. Walwala and Toba in Afghanistan cricketing circuit, unnamed Australian authorities, Mel Jones, and Catherine Ordway, a lawyer, academic, and sports integrity expert who has been part of tribunals. Catherine, who had helped her through the process, was at hand to receive her in Australia, and very soon would be referred to as “mum” by Benafsha. “ I remember the moment when we emotionally bonded. They had taken us, not long after arrival in Canberra, to the river. It was a man-made waterbody and was black in colour. I have never seen black waters before and even as I was talking to her, I held her hand. My friends whispered to me not to do it, and so I asked her if she minded. She had this bright smile when she said no, and gave me this hug. I call her mum, these days.” She plays for two clubs in Australia, she also played for Sydney University team briefly, and travelled to Fiji to play cricket with the organisation ‘Cricket without Borders’. In January, she will represent Afghan Women XI that will play against Cricket without Borders at MCG in Melbourne. “We shall get there early January and there will be selection trials. I would absolutely love it if I were the captain!” Not everything is hunky dory. The past has a way to cling on, leaving its residues in the soul. Benafsha often wakes up screaming at nights, calling out for her mother. “I would have different nightmares that also include me being about to be killed.” Seeing the alarmed face, she explains in a gentle voice as if speaking to a kid. “Don’t worry, it’s normal. In the most depressive times when one is in a place of great trouble, as I was in Kabul, nothing spills out. Your determination, your need to be positive and look ahead gets you through. Often, when you reach a safe place, with the troubles seemingly behind you, it’s when the trauma hits.” She is taking counselling and is all set to pursue her sports management course, that has psychology in the syllabus, at the Canberra University from February next year. She then cues up an awww moment with her own mother, who had worried about her playing cricket, worried about her straying outside on the streets, worried about her studying in Kabul - again her brother had insisted she must as it was the father’s dream and she was the brightest kid in the family. “One day here, she said, “Benafsha, without you, none of this would have been possible. I dread to think what would have happened to us in Kabul.” There is this look on Benafsha’s face as she recalls that - not a face of pride, surprisingly, but of love. And as he gets up to leave, ignoring protests that she has not even eaten anything and whether she needs a lift, Benafsha, which means 'violet' and whose nickname is 'Choti Shaitaan (Little Devil), beams this bright smile and says, “Don’t worry Janaab, I know my way, this is my country now!”",

    "description1": "Rohit Sharma didn’t open, choosing to bat at No.4 in the Prime Minister’s XI pink-ball game at Manuka Oval, triggering obvious thoughts about his batting position in the Adelaide Test. It does make sense after KL Rahul’s assured batting as an opener in both innings of the Perth Test, the way he mentored Yashasvi Jaiswal in the second dig there. It was Shubman Gill, who batted at three, reassuming his position that he has made his own, and made a neat fifty. It also allows Rohit, who has been a bit too impetuous in the recent Tests as an opener, to settle in a middle-order role. He lasted just 11 balls though against PM XI, chasing a ball well outside off from Charlie Anderson, and edging it to the slips. The crowd sensed that Virat Kohli was not at the ground - he had left by then—and a large section left the arena. Rishabh Pant, who kept for the first half of the PM XI’s batting innings before Sarfaraz Khan took over, too didn’t bat. Rohit’s batting position has been a topic of debate ever since Rahul batted as well as he did in the first Test. Perhaps, it would have been different had Rohit been in a richer vein of form. At his pomp as Test opener, he was the classic opener, not taking any risks, letting a ton of balls go through to the ‘keeper, taking his time to open up. But of late, he has been in a bit of a hurry, trying to stamp his authority rather quickly on the proceedings. The middle-order role allows him more breathing space, and less issues as he doesn’t have to face the moving pink ball. All else went pretty well for India. They won the toss and chose to bowl first to test their batting under lights. The pink ball did move around a bit, especially when new, in total contrast to the afternoon when it was pretty flat. The game itself was a bit of a friendly as India kept batting on even after they “won”, chasing down the 241-run target. Mid-afternoon rains had reduced the game from 50-overs to 46 and Sam Konstas-the 19-year old opener who has suddenly shot up in the national reckoning and was in the frame to be selected for the Perth Test-slammed an aggressive hundred.

If the ball jagged away, it would sail past the edge without any danger. Even the forward stride that was so precise and effective at Perth was on view here. His form gives additional reason for Rohit to go down the order. Gill eased into his knock without much fuss. There were a couple of deliveries initially when he had a bit of a poke and a miss, and Rahul came across for a mid-pitch chat. The ball had straightened or just about shaped away on those occasions. There weren't many alarms for him afterwards, and pretty soon in his piece, he unfurled his short-arm jabbed cut - that stroke without much follow-through and a shot that was reared on cement tracks in childhood. It’s quite a visual treat, as he allows the ball to come through and sort of hammers the nail on its head with one swift fluid move. A half-century for Shubman Gill in his first innings of India's Australian tour #PMXIvIND pic.twitter.com/YCPGFMqvs8 — cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) December 1, 2024 Jaiswal was squared-up a couple of times against the new ball cutting away from him. There were a couple more edged fours through slips as he tried to charge and heave once, and got a leading edge on the other when he tried to work the ball to the on side. But when he wanted to be compact and tight, he was. The only real sign of concern, if that word can be used, when he seemingly had a back spasm. He kept fiddling with his back and when it ailed him a tad bit more, he took treatment from the physio, as he lay on his stomach. But it must not have been something serious as he continued batting. Of all the Indian batsmen, he was the one who tried to be overtly aggressive, and eventually miscued a heave to cover. Nitish Reddy continued to be his impressively busy self. Just as he did to Nathan Lyon at Perth, he took the attack to the leg spinner Lloyd Pope. A charge down the track and a slog sweep had the crowd howling in delight but the shot of the game was his revere-swept boundary. It was some shot, to a full delivery outside off and Reddy just let his hands go through the shot in some style. India wrapped up the game, with most batsmen they wanted getting a hit, and the bowlers getting a bowl. Brief Scores: Prime Minister's XI 240 (Konstas 107, Jacobs 61, Rana 4-44) lost to India 257 for 5 (Gill 50, Jaiswal 45, Reddy 42, Washington 42*, Anderson 2-30) by five wickets.",

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/Arsneal-football.jpg",
    "description1": "Two events foreshadow an Arsenal corner kick. The moment the referee decrees one, Gabriel, the strapping centre-back, ambles to the vicinity of the far post. On the touchline, manager Mikel Arteta, perennially on an emotional edge, slouches onto his seat in the dug-out; set-piece coach Nicolas Jover, with a twinkle in his eyes, veers onto the touchline. Two events often follow an Arsenal corner kick too. The soaring giant of a man, Gabriel leaping above his markers, sliding and stretching his neck as though it were made of rubber and heading the ball into the net. Jover would leap and swipe the air. Since the start of last season, Arsenal have converted more set-pieces than any other club (25 excluding penalties) in the Premier League. Gabriel, unsurprisingly, has netted more goals than any other centre-back since his arrival in the 2021-22 season (15, the next best Virgil van Dijk has scored nine times). It’s so frequent that their supporters buzz as though they have earned a penalty. The action — from the time the ball goes out and the corner is swung — barely takes half a minute. In this time, the players move to their designated positions, which vary from match to match. But the most common pattern features one of Arsenal’s players rubbing shoulders with the goalkeeper inside the six-yard box, giving a false impression that he is the intended target. He is rather the decoy, his only intention being to distract the goalkeeper, manufacturing space for the intended target (often Gabriel, but not always him, as it could become too predictable). Gabriel lurks on the edge of the six-yard box, on the left. Three of them usually hover behind him, inside the 18-yard box. They are the dummy runners, trying to clear out the far post area. When the ball swings in, they often move towards the ball, dragging markers to the near post. One or two might linger just outside the box and the rest stand behind them, to thwart any counter-attack. So far, it’s straightforward. The deliveries, Bukayo Saka from the right and Declan Rice from the left, are largely in-swingers fired either on the goalkeeper or to the back post. Some bend late into the goal; some don’t. It's then the intricate patterns set in a fury of limbs moving this way or that. The runners from deep in the box charge in, the shield dishevels the goalkeeper or the nearest defender (sometimes controversially, and a reason perhaps the more stringent referees of Champions League award a foul against them). Gabriel’s opening goal against West Ham United this week",
    "description2": "end was a classic instance, when Jurren Timber bumped into the back of Lucas Paquetá at the front post, denying him the space to jump and clear the ball. It swirled into the path of Gabriel, who hit the target. West Ham players rebelled for a lost cause. As have several other teams the last two seasons. Ben White tried to undo the gloves of Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario before one of the corner-kick goals. Keeping opponents guessing Whereas Gabriel’s movements have been similar - a shimmy to the right (when delivered from the right), an explosive leap as he scuds the ball goalward - the rest of their movements are unpredictable. Sometimes, they drift into the box like a swarm of bees. Sometimes, they scatter like a regiment after a drill. It’s synchronised chaos, so second-guessing their patterns becomes difficult. These are movements chiselled to perfection on the training ground under Jover’s watch. The coach, who joined Arteta from Manchester City after he thought he was not getting enough time to work on set-pieces with the champions, more reliant on open play than set-pieces for goals, polished their set-pieces with intense, opponent-specific drills. The onus is on specific runs to sharpen their movements. Players are given just two seconds to run into a specific point to receive the ball, with Jover insisting on repeating and re-repeating the action until it becomes second nature. The season before Jover took over, Arsenal had scored just six goals from set-pieces in the entire season. Arteta can’t stop praising him. “Him and the rest of the staff have injected the belief into the players that there are many ways to win football matches. This is a really powerful one and he has given us a lot,” he once said. Jover is not the pioneer in set-piece coaching, but its most efficient exponent. The 43-year-old Frenchman has never played competitive football, but after completing his sports degree in Canada, joined the French club Montpellier as video analyst, before camping with the Croatian national team as match analyst. It was at Brentford in 2016 that he assumed the role of free-kick specialist. This was around the time teams were starting to focus more on set-pieces than ever before rather than decrying its lack of aesthetics, even though 28 percent of all goals every season arrive in this fashion. Earlier, it was seen as the refuge of teams in the relegation zone (as Brentford was when Jover joined the Bees). But no team has mastered the set-piece art like Arsenal. At the heart of it is Jover.",

    "description1": "The former bowling coach of India Bharat Arun was startled to hear Mohammad Siraj’s voice in a phone call. “He sounded a touch sad, down, then,” Arun tells this newspaper on a day where Siraj thanked Arun for a turnaround in his fortunes in Australia. At the end of the game against Prime Ministers XI at Canberra, Siraj talked about how he has “rediscovered the joy of bowling,” and how in the recent past he was “trying too hard to get wickets” and when it didn't come, it led to a vicious loop. Everyone mattered, he said, told him to not to over-stress about wickets and just bowl. Be it Jasprit Bumrah, who told him “don’t worry about wickets, it will come in due time. If it doesn’t, come to me.” Or Morne Morkel, the current bowling coach, who told him, “You are a warrior, don’t worry, just bowl,” Siraj recalled at the end of the PM XI game. But it was Arun’s advice that would give him the confidence to forget about wickets and enjoy the process. Arun recalls the conversation at the end of the home Test series against New Zealand. Siraj had been dropped from the second Test against New Zealand. “He told me that the ball was sliding towards leg, he wasn’t getting the swing and the seam position didn’t feel as ideal as before,” Arun shares. “I had been watching him and had noticed a few changes and asked him what he had been trying. In his pursuit of wickets, he had felt that he had to increase his pace, try to get more swing/movement and was putting more effort at release.” But all that had messed up with his original method. “The main problem as I saw it was his wrist wasn’t behind the ball, his most crucial weapon. In his effort to increase the pace, all these mistakes were creeping up. Perhaps he felt a bit rushed at the crease. What happens then is your body can also slide/tilt a bit more, especially if you are an open-chested bowler like him. That meant his radar was now going down,” he explains. “Without the wrist at the right place, the seam position too was getting affected. And instead of getting more movement that he wanted, the bowling was getting affected,” he adds.

    "description2": "o has mentored Siraj through his first-class years, knows what will work for him. “It’s no use saying get the wrist behind the ball; when you are edgy and worried, all that doesn’t make sense. I know Siraj, he works best when you give him a simple bowling plan, a drill, say.” So, Arun told him in a subsequent conversation to aim at one stump, and keep bowling. “That’s the off stump, so to speak, and if he wants he can bring the ball from just outside or straight. Setting a simple target like that forces accuracy,” he details. “I then told him to bowl a lot of yorkers at that one stump. Now, this is not to improve his yorkers but to get the wrist in the right position behind the ball. You can’t bowl yorkers, good ones that is, without the wrist in the right position. If it’s tilted or out of shape, then the ball won’t go where you want it to go.” In the subsequent conversations, Arun says it was a happier Siraj who called him to say that the yorker plan had worked. “When the wrist is behind, the pace also increases automatically. The accuracy is a lot better, and you can actually then bowl what you want to bowl: be it the one that cuts back in or straightens,” he says. “I talked to Bharat Arun sir. He said this is what is happening with me. He had known me for a long time,” Siraj would say at the end of the PM XI. “ I have been bowling very well for the last six-seven months but I wasn’t getting wickets. As a human being, you start wondering why you’re not getting wickets. So just trying a little too hard to get the wickets led me to miss my lines and lengths a little. So I sat at home and thought about why this is happening to me.” That’s when the thought hit him that he should call his old coach Arun. The proof that the plan worked out would come in Perth, Arun knew. So he watched the game intently. “That Smith wicket in the second innings was the ideal Siraj for me. How much did it move? Not much. It’s not what he was trying to do when he was down and in poor form; he had wanted lots of movement etc. That’s not him, as in that’s not his bowling style,” he says. Subsequently, his shoulder didn’t fall away prior to release. “That helps the ball in straightening and when it did, Smith edged it. For Siraj, the main thing is the wrist behind the ball. That’s the sign; for him if that happens, it means other things are in place: he is not falling away, he is not pushing the ball down, and he is hitting the right lengths,” he says.",

    "description1": "For about 25 minutes in Game 6 on Sunday – which eventually resulted in a draw after 46 moves - Ding Liren spent his time on the board with feet dipped in the warm pool of false hope. The two queens had spent the last few moves waltzing in the middle of the board, their gaze locked at each other. Ding’s queen shuffled backwards and forwards on d5 and d6 squares, batting its eyelashes at its counterpart. D Gukesh’s queen seemed to be following its lead, moving between e7 and g5 squares. Then, when one more step on the g5 square would have solemnised a draw by threefold repetition - which would have seen both players head into the second rest day of the 2024 World Chess Championship at three points each – the Indian’s queen opted to swipe left. Instead of heading to the e7 square, Gukesh’s queen went to h4, rejecting the advances of Ding’s queen. The 18-year-old from Chennai had chosen to spurn his world champion opponent’s very evident draw offer. Gukesh was in no mood to down weapons this early. Not right before a rest day, at least. So instead of playing 26…Qe7 for the third time, he instead played 26…Qh4. Call it the heady optimism of youth, or just the opportunistic psychological prodding of a player who knows what his opponent wants, and is ready to suffer himself for as long as possible just so that the other player is denied what he craves. Ding threw a few accusatory looks at his opponent at this stage, as if the Indian teen had been leading him on. “I thought I might be slightly worse. I wasn’t sure if I was. With the files open in front of his king, I thought I had counterplay. I saw no reason to go for the repetition. Not like I was playing for the win or anything, but I just wanted to play a few more moves and see what happened,” Gukesh said nonchalantly at the post-game press conference. So when had Gukesh decided that he would not play for the draw? Was it the second time he repeated the moves? Or was it just before it was time to move the queen for the third time?

Yesterday, thanks to a miracle, he got away. Gukesh is putting more pressure, but needs to be more exact,\" Anand said about Saturday’s Game 5. Just as Anand had indicated, Ding was playing risk-free chess in Game 6. Gukesh was taking a devil-may-care approach that possibly would have made his backroom team squirm. After all, it’s the world chess championship. If you’re in a position to take a draw, while you’re in a worse position, you take a draw. But Gukesh was clearly not in the mood for that sort of logic. “Even in an inferior endgame, Gukesh is trying instead of opting for a draw… But he wins the respect of a lot of fans! ” tweeted chess legend Susan Polgar, who later added: “I would be super nervous playing black here. Not easy at all!” The game did end in a draw. The queens were traded by the 35th move, something Ding had been attempting to do as early as the 13th move, trying to throw his destroyer-in-chief on squares where both queens could be exchanged. But Gukesh resisted, before finally giving in.

He blitzed his first 20 moves, spending barely seven minutes on them. In contrast, his teenage challenger was pushed into long phases of thought after the world champion employed the London System. Gukesh used up almost 53 minutes on his first 20 moves. At one point, Gukesh was trailing by as much as 45 minutes on the clock but managed to navigate himself out of trouble. But eventually, not just out-maneuvering himself out of trouble, he was also actively courting it in some phases. The result means that both players head into the second rest day of the world chess championship even on three points each.",

    "description1": "\n\n\nJohannesburg [South Africa], December 2 (ANI): As the SA20 league continues to grow, prominent cricket figures Graeme Smith, Dinesh Karthik, and Mark Boucher share their perspectives on where they see the league in the next decade. Their insights highlight the potential and ambition driving the tournament forward.\nGraeme Smith, the League Commissioner of SA20, reflects on the league's future with cautious optimism at SA20 India Day.\n\n\"I think 10 years is always tough to predict. But I think if we can follow at a level the same curve as IPL, that would be amazing,\" he said, as quoted by a release from SA20.\nSmith emphasized the importance of captivating fans in a competitive entertainment landscape.\n\"There's a lot of options for fans in today's world. We want to make sure that in our window that people are excited and tune in every year to see what SA20 is doing like they do with IPL, Premier League, football and others. We want to be one of the most established leagues and biggest outside India,\" he noted at SA20 India Day.\n\n\nIndian cricketer Dinesh Karthik envisions greater involvement from Indian players in the SA20 league over the next decade. He acknowledges the current BCCI policy but expresses hope for future participation. He is also the India Ambassador of SA20.\n\"In 10 years down the line, I can say that o",
    "description2": "bviously there is a policy in BCCI and everyone is adhering to that policy. But I hope I'm the first number to come out and play this league because I can definitely share my experience post the league how it was on a personal front,\" Karthik stated, as quoted by a release from SA20.\nHe highlighted the league's potential to enhance players' skills and financial stability.\n\"At the end of the day, all active players are looking for two things. A) How do I get better as a player? B) Financially, how is it viable? And on both fronts, I can confidently say that this segment is at a place which is definitely helping every player who is part of it,\" he said at SA20 India Day.\nMark Boucher, who is also the ambassador of SA20 league, also sees a bright future for the tournament. He draws parallels with the IPL's successful model, suggesting that SA20 could expand in a similar manner.\n\"I think to answer that as well, the template there and what the IPL has done. And you've got IPL owners involved in SA20 as well. So 10 years down the line, who used to say that there won't be another 4 or 5 teams? The template is there and it has certainly worked. So as long as SA20 carry on the same template, following the IPL, with the IPL owners, who's to know, I think it's going to be very successful,\" Boucher said, as quoted by SA20. (ANI)\n",
