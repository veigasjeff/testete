    "description1": "AWS CEO Matt Garman made a slew of announcements about the company’s AI offerings on Tuesday, December 3. At Amazon’s flagship cloud event, AWS re:Invent 2024, Garman reaffirmed the company’s longstanding commitment to innovation, with customers at its core. During the keynote, Garman announced upgrades to Amazon Bedrock, its platform designed to help companies build generative AI tools; the next generation of Amazon SageMaker; upgrades to Amazon Q Business; new capabilities for Amazon Q Developer; and more. Below is a look at some key announcements from the high-stakes keynote by Matt Garman. Amazon Bedrock gets new AI safeguards and more During his keynote, Garman introduced some enhancements to Amazon Bedrock, essentially making it more safe and efficient. The platform now has factual accuracy with automated reasoning, which is groundbreaking as it is a safeguard against AI hallucinations. Garman said that the tool offers logically accurate outputs, which is crucial for healthcare and finance sectors. Factual accuracy and automated reasoning are integrated with Bedrock Guardrails, and it validates responses, offers audit trails, and streamlines AI outputs. Another key update is the multi-agent collaboration, which means Amazon Bedrock agents will now support complex workflows by managing specialised AI agents. These agents will be able to work across diverse data sources to automate the most complex tasks, like financial analysis. Amazon Bedrock also gets cost-effective model customisation, which is essentially its new model distillation feature that allows customers to create smaller, faster models with performance on par with larger models. And it does this without the need of machine learning expertise. Garman said that users can fine-tune models for specific use cases, reducing costs and latency, making them suitable for real-time applications. Next-gen Amazon SageMaker Launched in 2017, Amazon SageMaker is essentially a cloud-based machine-learning platform that lets developers create, train, and deploy ML models on the cloud. At the event, Garman introduced the next generation of Amazon SageMaker with a slew of features such as SageMaker Unified Studio, SageMaker Catalog, SageMaker LakeHouse, and Zero-ETL integrations. While the SageMaker Unified Studio offers a centralised environment for data and AI development, allowing seamless access to organisational data, SageMaker Catalog enhances security and compliance by managing access to data and AI models. On the other hand, SageMaker Lakehouse offers unified access to diverse data sources, such as Amazon S3 and Redshift. Zero-ETL integrations let customers connect SaaS applications like Zendesk and SAP directly to SageMaker, eliminating the need for complex data pipelines. It needs to be noted that SageMaker Unified Studio is currently available in preview. Software development made ",
    "description2": "easy with Amazon Q Developer At the re:Invent event, Amazon announced upgrades to Amazon Q Developer, a generative AI assistant that has been developed to enhance software development. The new updates aim to make life easier for developers by automating tasks like unit testing, documentation, and code reviews, tasks that are usually seen as tedious. Besides, Amazon Q Developer can now autonomously identify and generate unit tests. It also automates the creation and maintenance of accurate documentation, making it easier for developers to keep project details updated. The tool now offers automated feedback, enhancing code reviews. With the new operational feature, developers and operators can instantly resolve issues by analysing large amounts of AWS data, locating the root cause of an issue, and helping users through fixes. The new Trainium3 chip The cloud computing giant also introduced Trianium3, which is its next-generation AI chip that has been developed to facilitate generative AI workloads. The new chip is built on a 3-nanometre process and offers improved performance, density, and power efficiency. The new chip is expected to power UltraServers that are four times more efficient than their predecessors. The first instances powered by Trainium3 will be available by late 2025. Amazon Nova models During the keynote, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced Amazon Nova, its new generation of foundation models. These models come with the ability to process text, images, and video as prompts. Essentially, consumers can use Amazon Nova-powered Gen AI applications to understand videos, charts, and documents, or generate the same. The Amazon Nova models available in Amazon Bedrock include the Amazon Nova Micro, Nova Lite, Nova Pro, Nova Premier, Nova Canvas, and Nova Reel. Jassy said that all the Nova models are incredibly fast, cost-effective, and have been developed to be used with ease. The Amazon CEO also demonstrated the performance of the new Nova models across various benchmarks. While Nova Lite seems to excel at cost-efficient multitasking, Nova Pro strikes a balance between speed and accuracy for diverse tasks, and Nova Micro has been optimised for low-latency responses. The new Nova models are versatile and showcase excellence across text, visual reasoning, adaptive workflows, etc. AWS has introduced numerous new features and models, and the list above is some of the most notable updates and announcements. By bringing generative AI to almost every aspect of its offering, AWS seems to be taking on Microsoft. With advancements like Trainium3 processors and going deeper with AI integration into its services, AWS is marching ahead within the generative AI race among enterprise solution providers. The Amazon company is also offering AI tools to migrate Windows apps to AWS. The author is at AWS re:Invent 2024 in Las Vegas at the invitation of AWS.",

    "description1": "Samsung's One UI 7, which the company says is one of the most significant updates to date is just around the corner. While the upcoming Android 15-based update brings a lot of new features, rumour has it that after discontinuing the Dex app for Windows, it is rumoured that One UI 7 may prevent users from downloading Edge Panels from the Galaxy Store. Introduced more than a decade ago, Edge Panels offer a quick way to access frequently used apps, widgets and information like weather, clipboard and more with a single swipe from any screen. According to a recent post by users on X (formerly Twitter), Samsung notified some users that when users update their device to One UI 7, they \"will no longer be able to download Edge Panels from Galaxy Store.\" Edge Panel will not be available in Galaxy Store with One UI 7 I already can't even see Edge Panel in there pic.twitter.com/iXMX4",
    "description2": "QgoMs — CID (@theonecid) November 28, 2024 However, there is some good news. The notification also states that once \"Edge Panels you have already downloaded before updating your device will still be available in the \"My apps\" section in Galaxy Store.\" Also, Edge Panels that you downloaded before updating to One UI 7 will be available to use, but if you happen to uninstall a panel, there is no way to re-download it. Another thing to note here is that if you purchase a device that ships with One UI 7 out of the box, all your previously downloaded panels can still be downloaded from the Galaxy Store. For those wondering, support for downloadable Edge Panels isn't the only thing Samsung is removing with One UI 7. Recently, the South Korean tech giant updated its DeX support page, notifying users that the DeX for Windows app will no longer be supported with the upcoming update.",

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/Tech-feature-images54.jpg",
    "description1": "AI-generated music has emerged as a flashpoint in the ongoing battle between tech companies and intellectual property (IP) holders. While musicians and record labels have accused tech companies of scraping copyrighted songs to train their AI models, some artists are also actively embracing AI as a music-making tool. Amid this controversy, Musical AI and Beatoven.ai have joined hands to develop a new AI product claimed to be “the world’s first full-song generator that is completely legal and licensed.” In a partnership announced on Tuesday, December 3, the two startups said that the new service will use AI to generate music while ensuring that the outputs are based on fully licensed tracks and the rightsholders are compensated. The AI model will be trained on three million songs, loops, samples, and sounds. It is currently under development and will be launched in the second half of 2025. While the AI song generator will be developed by Beatoven.ai, it will be trained on the existing rightsholders catalogs of Musical AI, an Al training license management and attribution platform. Musical AI will also be responsible for making payments to the rightsholders. Additionally, its enterprise clients will have exclusive access to the AI song generator",
    "description2": ". “Based on usage by the outputs provided by Musical AI technology, rightsholders will receive an appropriate share of the model’s revenue, much as they do when music is streamed on a commercial service,” the AI startup said in a press release. “There are no more excuses for not doing things right and well. We’re proving this with this first-ever service,” said Sean Power, the CEO of Musical AI. Meanwhile, Beatoven.ai CEO Mansoor Rahimat Khan said that the partnership will “set the way forward for how business models need to be built in AI with the rightsholders being compensated for the data the models are trained on.” “We have historically been adopting this model in direct partnerships with independent artists and by joining hands with Musical AI we will build a sustainable revenue sharing model using their attribution technology,” he added. Earlier this year, AI startups Suno and Udio were sued by major record labels such as Sony, Universal Music, Atlantic Records, Warner Bros, Capitol Records, and a few others. The lawsuits alleged that the two companies had committed copyright infringement on an “almost unimaginable scale” and sought a compensation of $150,000 (Rs 1,25,00,000) for every track whose copyright had allegedly been violated.",

While the QR code on PAN was introduced back in 2017-18, many users still have an older PAN without a QR code. With still a few months left for the official rollout of PAN 2.0, here is a detailed guide on how to apply for a new PAN 1.0 with a QR code. What's the use of a QR code on a PAN card? According to the Ministry of Finance, a dedicated QR code scanner can verify the PAN holder's photo, signature, name, parent's name, and date of birth, making it much easier to authenticate the data presented on the physical PAN card. Do note that your existing PAN card without a QR code will continue to remain valid, and applying for a PAN with a QR code is only for those who need one, and is not mandatory. To apply for an u",

Depending on the source of the application, one needs to apply for PAN 1.0 via NSDL or UTIITSL, and users will have the option to get only ePAN with QR or a physical PAN card with a QR code. Although downloading the ePAN does not cost money for those whose PAN was issued within the last month, users with older PANs need to pay Rs 8.26 to obtain an ePAN with a QR code. Similarly, to get a physical PAN with a QR code, one needs to pay Rs 50. ePAN with QR code will come in a PDF format and will be password protected for additional safety. If you are not sure about your source of application for PAN, go to either NSDL or UTIITSL and enter the basic details. The site will redirect you to the specific source where you can obtain an ePAN or a PAN with a QR code.",

    "description": "With the Pixel 9 Pro, Google has created the almost perfect premium small phone to date.",
    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/11/google-pixel-9-pro-review.jpg",
    "description1": "My fascination with small phones is well-documented, and nobody is a bigger fan of the iPhone 13 mini than I am. However, the device has started to age, and I feel it’s time to move on, which I did recently with the iPhone 16 Pro (I also use the Pixel 9 Pro Fold frequently—and gosh, it’s gorgeous). Yet, I still crave a small phone, and I don’t think Apple has plans to revive the iPhone Mini series—at least not anytime soon. For now, I have found a new companion in the Google Pixel 9 Pro (it successfully became my secondary device for a couple of days). A flagship-grade small phone was long overdue, and the Pixel 9 Pro, as a device, is both exciting and frustrating at times. I’ll get into where the Pixel 9 Pro excels and where it falls short in my review. Google Pixel 9 Pro price in India (as reviewed): Rs 1,09,999 Small is beautiful The moment I got the Pixel 9 Pro out of the box, I was surprised by its size. The Pixel 9 Pro XL (which I recently reviewed, and you can check out the review here) was huge in comparison. The Pixel 9 Pro is compact and fits perfectly into any pocket—literally any pocket—and the good thing is that the screen doesn’t feel small at all. I wouldn’t call it a tiny phone like the iPhone 13 Mini, which featured a 5.4-inch screen with tiny bezels and a reduced notch. The Pixel 9 Pro, on the other hand, has a 6.3-inch, 120 Hz, LTPO OLED display with up to 3,000 nits of brightness. The display is super bright and fast, with only small bezels and a single camera cut-out. After two weeks of using the phone, the screen feels normal. Honestly, while using the iPhone 13 Mini, it was always imprinted in my mind that it was a small phone and thus came with its shortcomings. That isn’t the case with the Pixel 9 Pro. As I mentioned, the 6.3-inch display is respectable in size—not as small as the 5.4-inch screen on the iPhone 13 Mini but still relatively compact. This is particularly small compared to today’s average smartphones, where a 6.8-inch display has become the standard. What impressed me about the Pixel 9 Pro, as with the iPhone 13 Mini, is how comfortable it is for one-handed use. I can easily take the phone out of my pocket and operate it with one hand. I know the struggle of holding a big phone while trying to shoot a video or take a photograph. I can also type a message with one hand while standing in a crowded place. The advantages of a small phone are there, and you need to embrace the size. The Pixel 9 Pro was made with the intention of being a premium flagship smartphone, and it shows in its design. I think it’s one of the best-looking high-end smartphones on the market and possibly the best small phone out there. Period. My review unit came in a lighter shade of pink (called Rose Quartz, by the way), and it’s pleasing to the eye, though I would have loved to see Google experiment with bold and fun colours similar to what Apple did with the new iMac. The screen is flat, while the body of the Pixel 9 Pro is square-ish with rounded corners, reminiscent of recent iPhones. The camera array on the back now features a raised oval island. It’s a controversial design—some might like it, while others may hate it. It protrudes quite far from the back of the phone, making a case necessary to protect the device. Additionally, I must note that it’s a very slippery phone due to the choice of materials and finish. That being said, the device feels expensive in the hand and has a Pixel-esque aesthetic, which matters a lot when Google is charging a premium for a phone like this. The camera triumphs The Pixel’s camera holds its ground to this day, even when smartphone cameras, in general, are fairly good across all models—no matter which device you pick up at any price point—and computational photography has become an integral part of modern phone camera design. However, I still feel that Google has an edge, and its Pixel phones still produce my favourite photographs. The Pixel 9 Pro has a triple-camera setup: a 50MP 1 sensor with an f aperture, a 48MP 1 sensor with a slightly improved f aperture (up from f on the Pixel 8 Pro), and a 12mm equivalent focal length. The telephoto camera also features a 48MP 1 sensor with an f aperture and a 5x optical zoom, with an equivalent focal length of 110mm. Many people don’t even know the camera specs, and it’s fair not to place too much emphasis on camera hardware. However, you need the best possible combination of camera hardware and software to achieve photographs that are less dramatic, true to the subject and have the sharpness and clarity that make each photo stand out as if you were part of the scene. The more I tried the Pixel 9 Pro’s camera, the better I was able to distinguish where the Pixel camera excels and where its shortcomings lie when compar",
    "description2": "ed to the iPhone 16 Pro’s camera, which also has its share of highs and lows. Not many may admit it, but it's important to highlight this as a reviewer. The Pixel 9 Pro is better at highlighting shadows, and skin tones generally appear more colour-accurate than on the iPhone. However, there are times when the Pixel reduces warm tones in a picture, and the colour auto-corrects too much. On the iPhone 16 Pro, I found that Apple has improved the phone’s 5X telephoto lens, and images appear sharper in low light. The Pixel also excels in video quality (the Pixel 9 Pro now offers 8K video recording using the Video Boost feature) and is particularly good at taking panoramas. However, the iPhone remains superior in overall video performance. That being said, the Pixel 9 Pro’s camera system is excellent and second to none (for example, the night mode is very impressive, as is the portrait mode), but it has its own flair and quirks that you won’t find on any other smartphone. It’s good to see the new selfie camera on the Pixel 9 series, which offers slightly more detailed images. You can use the Portrait option to create a shallow depth-of-field effect, although this has resulted in less realistic edges in my testing. Likeable performance, but the Pixel 9 Pro’s battery life surprised me Like other devices in the Pixel 9 series, the Pixel 9 Pro (my unit came with 256GB of storage and 16GB of RAM) uses the latest in-house produced Google chip: the G4. I am not into benchmarking and have no interest in comparing raw specs; all I care about is how the device feels on a day-to-day basis. The G4 feels powerful in regular everyday tasks such as browsing, social media, taking photos, navigating, and accessing apps. I found the phone to be much more capable of gaming, which surprised me. I did not notice the phone getting warm, as was the case with previous generations of Pixel devices. This is surely an improvement, as is the battery life. I was expecting the Pixel 9 Pro’s 4,700mAh battery to last as long as the iPhone 13 Mini in battery life, and to my surprise, the phone was able to last throughout the day, especially on days when I was out and had heavy app usage. When I got back home on those days, I found my phone with at least 15 to 20 per cent battery life left. However, don’t expect the battery life to last for two full days of use and even compare the Pixel 9 Pro to the Pixel 9 Pro XL and iPhone 16 Pro Max in terms of battery life. Android 15 and Pixel AI: A mixed bag The Pixel 9 series recently received an update to Android 15, and honestly, the latest software update brought very few new features. It's neither exciting nor does it alter the interface, which I feel has already started to stagnate. However, if you ask me, only two new features in Android 15 stand out: a) Private Space, which allows users to create a password-protected area within the phone for any apps or documents they might want to keep hidden. However, it’s not as user-friendly as I’d hoped. You need to sign in separately and re-download any apps you've installed in the \"public\" part of your phone, and it's not always clear how to hide certain files. b) The new Theft Detection feature is cool; it recognizes if your phone is snatched from your hand and instantly locks your screen to stop the thief from accessing your personal information. AI is a big part of the Pixel 9 Pro, and I have written in the past about how generative artificial intelligence features are more of a novelty at the moment and not as truly useful as Google wants users to believe. However, there are a few Google AI features that I found genuinely useful, such as the live transcription feature, which I feel is better than Apple’s AI. I also like Pixel Studio for creating generative AI pictures, and I use it frequently. However, I don’t use Gemini Live much; instead, I simply search the web. Should you buy the Google Pixel 9 Pro? I think it all depends on whether you need a smartphone with a small form factor. The Pixel 9 Pro is as capable as the Pixel 9 Pro XL because the hardware is exactly the same, with the only differences being the smaller screen and battery on the Pixel 9 Pro. I’m genuinely happy to be using the Pixel 9 Pro; it feels like a true flagship smartphone that is designed for small phone lovers like myself, and that is also its main selling point—of course, the camera is excellent. For me, though, the Pixel 9 Pro remains a superb smartphone—one of the best compact smartphones you can buy today.

    "description1": "Every time I attend a press launch event, a product briefing, or an interview, I make sure to carry my Moleskine reporter's notebook. It’s an integral part of what I do, and I’m sure my fellow journalists can relate to this. I often joke that you’re not a journalist if you don’t carry a notepad with you. However, as a tech journalist writing about personal technology for a living, I also try to review new products and incorporate them into my daily routine to see how I can benefit from them. Recently, I had the opportunity to try out the new iPad mini, and honestly, what intrigued me more than the usual features associated with the iPad was the idea that I could replace my pen and notebook with it. As I began using the iPad mini almost daily, I started to appreciate the device more. Reporting isn’t just about observing; it’s also about understanding the world around you. Apple’s little tablet serves not only as a tool for taking notes but also as a dictaphone, an AI assistant, and a camera, all rolled into one. Perhaps an integral part of my job is to share what I observe, and the iPad mini represents a new form of a reporter’s notebook as it embodies the accountability that comes with being a journalist. Here’s my review of the iPad mini. Apple iPad mini price in India: Rs 49,900 onwards (excludes the cost of Apple Pencil Pro) How I use the iPad I have been using the iPad for over a decade now, and I’m happy to be called a seasoned iPad user. There was a time when I switched to the iPad completely, totally replacing my Mac, and that phase lasted for a few years—until the M1 Mac came out, at which point I went back to using the Mac. I wouldn’t say I have an on-and-off relationship with the iPad. I still use it a lot, but not necessarily as a Mac replacement, as much as Apple would like me to. Instead, I enjoy taking notes on the iPad with the Apple Pencil, recording voice notes during product briefings, attending video calls, listening to music on Apple Music, and sometimes playing games. Honestly, I neither recommend buying the iPad Pro for these activities, nor would I want to spend that much money just to stream a Netflix show on it. I’m not into coding or making music, so I don't see the need for the iPad Pro or a premium tablet. It took me a while to figure out which iPad works for me, and considering I already use a Mac for computing tasks and the iPhone for phone-related activities, the iPad mini stands out for the things I want to do on a tablet. My love for dedicated devices If you ever peek into my tote bag and wonder why I carry so many different devices: an iPhone, an iPad, an iPod, a Nintendo Switch, a MacBook, a Kindle 3rd generation and a Samsung Galaxy camera. This is who I am; I’m a bit weird—someone who still listens to music on an iPod and uses wired earbuds. I like dedicated devices for different purposes, and I don’t regret that choice. I don’t believe a single device can replace every other device on the market. Maybe that's why I chose the iPad mini over the other iPads. It feels different, excels in one or two areas, and looks like what a tablet should be. This is the only iPad in Apple’s product portfolio that stays true to the original iPad. Small and compact I’m glad that Apple didn’t market the iPad mini as a computer like it did with the iPad Air and iPad Pro. The essence of the iPad mini lies in its small, compact footprint and its simplicity as a tablet. I’m sure you get that feeling when you pick up the mini. The 8-inch screen makes it just the right size for me to hold while lying on my back in bed, though I would say it isn’t as light as a Kindle. In terms of size, the Mini has been wonderful. It’s small enough that I can tuck it into a tote bag when I take public transportation or Uber, and it slides into even a stuffed backpack. It’s extremely lightweight (even with a protective case), which makes it a dream to travel with. That’s what I love about the iPad mini: you know it’s a tablet, and the Mini’s design and form make that clear. If you need an iPad for reading eBooks or taking notes, the Mini is the perfect choice. I didn’t get the same feeling when I was using the new iPad Air (the one with the 12.9-inch display)—the bulkier external keyboard doesn’t really suit a device as small as this. However, with the iPad mini, the design is intentional: you know it doesn’t support a Magic Keyboard, so you already understand its best use case. In my case, I use the Mini as a notebook replacement and jot down notes with the Apple Pencil. I also carry the Mini during interviews, keeping it on the table to record live transcriptions with Voice Notes. My life is sorted. The Mini features the flat-sided design of the iPad Pro, which I really like. That flat side enables support for the USB-C Apple Pencil as well as the Apple Pencil Pro (more on that later), which attaches magnetically to the side of the iPad and charges inductively. However, there’s no support for Face ID, as biometric authentication occurs via Touch ID integrated into the wake/sleep button on the edge of the iPad. The iPad mini offers a slightly less capable USB-C port and lacks the Thunderbolt port found on the iPad Pro. But nothing detracts from how the Mini feels as a device, because its purpose is well defined—what a small tablet can possibly do. The right screen size The screen display was a big selling point for me when switching to the iPad mini. First, the 8.3-inch screen size is just right for me—somewhere between the iPhone 16 Pro’s 6.3 inches and the MacBook Air’s 13 inches. Second, the screen size allows me to read eBooks on the go, which I’m not as comfortable doing on the iPad Air’s 12.9-inch screen. Finally, the Mini’s size and screen are perfect for taking notes. However, the iPad mini lacks a ProMotion display or an OLED display. I do feel that Apple could have included a high-refresh-rate",
    "description2": " display on the Mini. That would have been great, especially since many people who pick up this device likely intend to use it as an eBook reader or for gaming. I paired a keyboard with the Mini Apple has gotten a lot right with the iPad mini, but there is a caveat I must admit, as a fan of compact devices. The more you use the Mini, the more you realise that the on-screen keyboard isn’t great. The small form factor limits its usability for writing beyond a certain point. The landscape keyboard is cramped, while the portrait keyboard feels too large. Overall, the on-screen keyboard doesn’t provide a satisfying experience. That's why I paired an external keyboard for typing, which has greatly elevated my writing experience. However, you’ll never be completely satisfied. I have been using a mechanical keyboard with the Mini, and so far, the experience has been great. But I wouldn’t want to completely switch from my Mac. That being said, it doesn’t stop the Mini from being a capable portable writing machine when paired with a great keyboard. I have figured out how to write more effectively on the iPad mini and how to do it. That’s a fun aspect of using the iPad mini, or any iPad in general. I can try new keyboards and accessories to find what works for me. The do-it-yourself (DIY) approach is fantastic because it gives you the freedom to explore new ways of using a device despite certain shortcomings. A powerful processor and support for Apple Intelligence But the Mini feels like a powerful device with plenty of capability for the tasks it is designed for. The new Mini has been upgraded to the A17 Pro chip (the same one found in the iPhone 15 Pro). Scrolling through LinkedIn, reading newspapers, and visiting websites all worked just fine. I have also used the Mini as an eBook reader by firing up the Kindle app, and the device felt great. I'm not someone who will use the Mini for extraordinary tasks because I have a Mac for that. I know what type of user I am and why I’m so inclined toward the iPad mini. This understanding helps me appreciate the Mini better and see what it can do for me. The Mini also supports the brand-new Apple Intelligence (I tested a beta version; the public rollout might take a little longer, likely in early 2025 for India) on top of iPadOS. I have been using Apple's AI system for months since it was announced back in June, and my take on Apple getting into generative artificial intelligence is something I have been saying for a long time: it's familiar and helpful, but not out of this world. There are some features that are generally useful, such as writing tools that make your emails sound more professional and AI-powered audio transcription in the Voice Memos and Notes apps. I am already using the AI audio transcriptions in Voice Memos, and I can't tell you how helpful they are. This feature was long overdue and aligns perfectly with the iPad mini more than with any other device. Recently, I interviewed a developer on a video call using the iPad mini, recorded the conversation on the device itself, and used the Voice Memos app’s built-in ability to transcribe the entire interview into text. I then pasted the text into Google Docs, writing a copy on the Mini using the external keyboard. That’s my unique use case for the iPad mini. The note-taking ability is a standout feature Perhaps the primary reason I was so enamoured with the iPad mini is its note-taking capability. In my case, the device that comes closest to replacing a Moleskine reporter's notebook is the iPad mini. Its small size, the quality of the screen, and the ability to use the Apple Pencil Pro (the one I use for taking notes) transform the Mini into a writing and sketching device. My handwriting is awful (and only I can understand it), but I never stopped writing on paper. Sure, I may not be an artist or the best person to review the new Apple Pencil Pro, but I appreciate what Apple has done with this advanced stylus. The pencil’s haptic feedback dramatically improves the double-tap gesture and enhances the new squeeze gesture that brings up a contextual menu. There’s so much to love about the Pencil Pro, but I must say that as I use it more to take notes, I’ve realised just how bad my handwriting is. The good thing is that I still haven’t stopped writing or jotting down notes, and the Pencil Pro is helping me improve my handwriting—just one step at a time. Mini vs. Pro I brought up this question for a reason, and the answer lies in a simple fact: the iPad mini is a tablet and thus can’t replace your Mac. The iPad Pro is absolutely a beast and can come close to replacing the Mac, but it all depends on what type of user you are. I never tried to do Mac tasks on the iPad mini because I know it can’t handle them. Instead, the iPad mini shines in the areas that truly define the iPad, complemented by its form factor, screen size, and support for the Apple Pencil. That being said, the iPad mini is not perfect, and there’s room for improvement. Perhaps there could be new creative ways to add accessories and enhance the experience without necessarily requiring beefed-up performance, as Apple has done this time. Unfortunately, Apple Intelligence isn’t really a solution to the iPadOS problems. The issues that users typically complain about regarding iPadOS and how devices like the iPad Pro have been held back don’t really apply to the iPad mini. That’s where I feel a distinction needs to be made, and the user interface needs to be reevaluated with the form factor in mind to make iPadOS feel much better and more fluid. Apple iPad mini (2024) Pros Cons Small and compact footprint 60Hz display Supports Apple Intelligence Front camera is awkwardly placed Compatible with Apple Pencil Pro Missing FaceID 5G compatibility Performance boost with A17 Pro Double the storage over predecessor Access to Center Stage for video calls &nbsp;",

    "description1": "What is the best Android tablet one can buy? For years, this has had just one answer, a Samsung Galaxy Tab. The Korean tech giant hopes to underline this for another year with its new Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra 5G, the tablet equivalent of its smartphone flagship. But is the new Tab S10 Ultra really worth the legacy it carries with it? I used it for a few days, and here is what I thought. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra 5G is a sleek tablet despite its large 14.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display. The tablet has a size that other companies don’t offer and is clearly aimed at those who need the larger canvas to capitalise on the S-pen's ability to take your creativity to a whole new level. Buy this is a large tablet and you need to be mindful of that, especially the wide, or long, orientation of the device. Thankfully, this tablet is so thin and light that it compensates for its size. I am used to carrying my iPad on trips and even the Apple tablet gets a bit hard to manage from an Indigo seat. The Tab S10 Ultra is much bigger and will only struggle more. In contrast, this is a great device to have on your office table or while you are lounging on the sofa at home to scribble down your thoughts or just consume the latest Netflix show on the stunning Samsung screen. In fact, I was impressed by the audio and video playback capabilities of the device, making it perfect for binge-watching a new show or just flipping through The Indian Express morning edition PDF. And contrary to what I said about the size, I would still stash this into my carry-on bag to watch a movie on the next flight to Mumbai. The audio playback is as powerful as a small Bluetooth speaker and can fill the room on a quiet day. The anti-reflection screen makes this a device with which you can take your reading to an outside cafe or the balcony of your beach resort. As always, the best part of getting a Samsung tablet is the S-Pen. I have been saying that Samsung devices are an S-Pen length ahead of the competition. The same is the case with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra where I found the S-Pen to have improved on its pressure sensitivity with a softer tip. The tablet makes more sense with the S-Pen. Take the stylus off its magnetic perch on the back of the tablet and you have a perfect slate to write on, es",
    "description2": "pecially when holding the tablet in a vertical orientation. The S-Pen glides on the screen capturing your handwriting perfectly. Here I was annotating PDFs and making notes for new projects with the S-Pen menu helping me make the choice every time I took to the pen. Over the years, Samsung has perfected the use of a stylus on the tablet with both hardware and software. There is a new aspect that is mindblowing in many ways. The Sketch to Image feature converts any doodle you create into a respectable painting. I finally got to see what all the doodles I have been working on since childhood would really look like if I had some actual artistic skills. This is also a good way to give wings to your ideas and will really interest a lot of users. With the Samsung Ultra Book Cover (which costs extra) this slate is powerful in more ways than one to become your primary computing device, taking charge of all your creative duties. This is also the first Samsung flagship device powered by a MediaTek processor, the Dimensity 9300+, and it has a bumped-up performance. The processor ensures that the device stays cool whatever you do, be it streaming for hours or playing a new game. Plus, you now have actual AI features rolling out into the device, which means the on-device computing power has to be top-notch at all times. The camera too has AI features like in the new Samsung phones and you can use it to move around some subject in the frame or erase it completely. The one aspect that did not impress me was the camera performance in low light as the images turned out too noisy. The battery life is impressive, especially given the thin frame of the device, and can last two full days of moderate use, especially if you are not using the 5G at all times. At a starting price of Rs 108,999 for the Wi-Fi version, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is undoubtedly the best Android tablet of 2024. Buy the pricier 5G version (starting at Rs 122,999) if you are always on the move. With the S-Pen and the new AI features, there is little the competition can do to come close to what this tablet offers. However, if you are already a Tab S9 user then wait for the upgrade as expected for the chip as this device is almost similar to yours. New users need to check out the size of this tablet before committing.",

    "description1": "The 10th edition of the Apple Watch, the world’s most popular timepiece, is now out. While Apple celebrated 10 years of the iPhone with the iPhone X series that ushered in a new design philosophy, there are no such big flourishes with the Apple Watch Series 10. Maybe it is not the right time, or perhaps the time is such that nothing new is waiting to be done. As a regular Apple Watch user, I was excited to a certain extent by the larger display on the thinner device and wanted to see if that would change my usage. Here is what I found. Compared to the Apple Watch Series 9 (review), you can see and feel the extra real estate. With some of the new watch faces like Flux, the screen is fully utilised. And with apps like the New York Times, the alerts are now more readable with the extra real estate. But I would have loved a few new apps that are making full use of these two extra millimetres and thinner bezels on your hand. Also, the Apple Watch is now a tad bit thinner than before. After wearing it for a day I realised that this might be the Apple Watch I can wear to bed without being irritated much — I am a light sleeper and keep blaming everything from an afternoon coffee to the type of bed linen for my lack of sleep. It also makes sense to wear the Apple Watch to sleep now as you have the new Vitals app, which uses overnight readings to give you insights into your health. So far it tells me everything is in range. The readings, however, start appearing only after you wear the watch to sleep for at least four-five days, one of the reasons this review took longer than anticipated. The polished titanium feel makes it stylish, especially with the blacks. You can use some of the ne",
    "description2": "w watch faces to make people notice your new investment. With WatchOS photos can be converted into watch faces via the phone too. I like this feature as you get the reassurance of family every once in a while during the day. However, I wonder if this taking the personal too public; but then we put family pics on the larger phone lock screen as well. Another aspect I found effective was the fast charging on the Apple Watch Series 10. My old charging dock by the bed has been giving me issues of late and I have come to realise that when I pick up the watch for use just before leaving for office, it is usually short of charge. Now, in the office, I put it on the Daily Objects Surge Max dock for a few minutes and get enough juice to last the rest of the day. This is a sea change from the time it took hours to charge the Apple Watch. For my regular use of the Apple Watch, to track my daily quota of 10000 steps, regular heart rate checks, and mapping with my insurance and health apps, the Series 10 does well. The new Vitals app is an added layer here and will keep tab even when I’m sleeping. For the past couple of weeks, I have been using the Series 10 for my daily usage, and I am more than happy with the performance and battery life, compared to the earlier Series 9. However, unless you are on versions before the Series 8, it will not make much sense to upgrade to this one as the changes will not be that discernible. For users of older Apple Watches, this is an upgrade at many levels from performance to screen size and battery life. At Rs 46,900, the best smartwatch has become better, though the upgrade this time makes more sense for those who have held on to the upgrade for longer.",

A typical U.S. nuclear plant has a capacity of about 1 gigawatt. \"At Meta, we believe nuclear energy will play a pivotal role in the transition to a cleaner, more reliable, and diversified electric grid,\" the company said in a release. U.S. data center power use is expected to roughly triple between 2023 and 2030 and will require about 47 gigawatts of new generation capacity, according to Goldman Sachs estimates.

Meta said it will take submissions from developers that want to take part in the request for proposals until Feb. 7, 2025. The company said it was using the request-for-proposal process because, compared to renewable energy projects like solar and wind, nuclear is more capital-intensive, takes longer to develop, and is subject to more regulatory requirements. \"An RFP process will allow us to approach these projects thoroughly and thoughtfully with these considerations in mind,\" it said.",

    "description1": "Last week, the Australian Parliament passed a law that bans social media use for individuals under 16. This move has sparked global debate, with critics warning that it may push teenagers toward the dark web or lead to social isolation. The law highlights growing concerns around the impact of social media, which, when not controlled, can become highly addictive and result in dependency. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, and X often contribute to a decline in productivity, mental well-being, and real-life relationships. The key question is how to detox from social media and regain control of our digital lives.Why is social media detox important?Social media can significantly affect our mental health and productivity if not used mindfully. Many people unknowingly develop unhealthy habits, constantly checking notifications, scrolling through feeds, and comparing their lives to others. This dependency not only reduces real-life interactions but can also increase feelings of anxiety, loneliness, and even lead to issues like FOMO (fear of missing out). Detoxing from social media allows individuals to reassess their relationship with these platforms and reduce their negative impact.Strategies to reduce social media’s gripStep 1: Monitor your usageBefore you remove all social apps, the first step is to track your social media usage. Both Apple and Google offer built-in tools to help you monitor how much time you spend on apps.Apple’s screen time: On iPhones, this feature gives a detailed breakdown of app usage, including the total time spent, the apps you use the most, and how often you unlock your phone. It allows you to set daily limits for specific apps, making it easier to control how much time you spend on social media each day.Google’s digital wellbeing: For Android users, Google provides a similar tool that tracks screen time and app usage. This graph gives a visual representation of your daily activity, helping you understand your habits and identify areas for improvement.Step 2: Use detox appsSeveral apps can assist you in reducing social media usage, encouraging better digital habits.Dumb phone: This app creates a minimalist home screen by removing non-essential apps, which discourages mindless scrolling. ",
    "description2": "It simplifies your phone experience, making it less tempting to pick it up constantly. It’s a great first step for those who need a gentle nudge toward reducing usage.Opal: Opal helps users break their social media addiction by blocking distracting apps. It tracks screen time and provides insights into how much time is spent on digital distractions. It even calculates the potential long-term impact of your usage habits. The app promotes accountability by allowing you to share your progress with friends.Forest: A fun and interactive app, Forest encourages users to stay off their phones by gamifying the experience. As you avoid checking your phone, a virtual tree grows. If you use your phone, the tree dies. As you build more trees, you accumulate virtual coins that can be used to plant real trees, making your digital detox environmentally beneficial as well.Step 3: Consider a real detox phoneFor those who want a more drastic break from social media, a \"dumb phone\" might be the solution. Devices like the Nokia 2660 Flip offer basic phone functions without the distractions of modern smartphones. They allow users to enjoy the benefits of communication while freeing themselves from the constant pull of social media. The Nokia 2660 Flip’s retro design and simple functionality make it an appealing choice for those seeking a true digital detox.Step 4: Set clear goalsIf completely removing social media isn’t possible or desirable, set gradual goals to reduce your usage. Be realistic about your timeframes, and remember that breaking an addiction takes time. Define specific targets, like reducing screen time by 20% each week, and use the tools mentioned to monitor progress.Step 5: Combine detox with mindfulnessApps alone won’t solve the problem unless accompanied by a mindful approach to daily life. Consider replacing social media time with activities that promote well-being, such as reading, exercising, cooking, or spending time with loved ones. These activities can help you reconnect with the physical world and improve your overall mental health.By incorporating these strategies, you can reduce social media’s grip on your life and foster healthier, more meaningful connections with the digital world.Also Read | WhatsApp Web | Telegram Web ",

    "description1": "Black Friday is one of the best times of the year to buy new gadgets and gizmos; however, a true tech fanatic usually waits until Cyber Monday, which will have more enticing deals and discounts on electronic gadgets such as smartphones, laptops, gaming consoles, and accessories. While Cyber Monday deals are hugely popular in Western countries, they have also become common in India over the last few years, with many major retailers and e-tailers participating. Do note that some of these deals are still listed under Black Friday sales, but they can be considered Cyber Monday deals. Here are five tech deals currently live on various e-commerce platforms in India that are worth considering this Cyber Monday: Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Deals on the Galaxy S23 Ultra get better with every passing month, and Samsung's previous flagship is currently selling at its all-time low price of Rs 72,999, making it an enticing deal for anyone looking for a high-end Android flagship smartphone with cutting-edge camera capabilities, Galaxy AI, and a phone with an integrated stylus. Despite being almost two years old, the Galaxy S23 Ultra (review) has aged like fine wine, and at its current price, there are few smartphones as versatile and reliable as the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. Sony PS5 Slim Digital Edition This one is a repeater from our Black Friday deal picks. At its discounted price of Rs 37,490, it offers unbeatable gaming performance that's plenty powerful. With its slimmer and modular design that allows users to add a Blu-ray drive when needed, this is easily one of the best gaming consoles that officially sell in India. Besides being a gaming console, it can also double as a platform ",
    "description2": "where one can watch movies and TV shows on platforms like Netflix and Prime Video. MacBook Air M1 For anyone looking for a new laptop for around Rs 50,000 and inclined toward a Mac, the MacBook Air M1 is a fantastic deal. It combines the premium metal unibody build, reliability, and battery life, and despite being officially discontinued by Apple, it has everything one expects from a modern MacBook, including Apple Intelligence. At its current discounted price of Rs 56,990, no Windows laptop comes close to the MacBook Air in value, except for a few cases like gaming. HP Victus Gaming Laptop If you are looking for a gaming laptop and the MacBook isn't even on your radar, the HP Victus Gaming Laptop, priced at Rs 59,990, can be a great alternative to the MacBook Air, especially if you are a gamer. Powered by the AMD Ryzen 5 5600H CPU and NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU with 4 GB of VRAM, it is clearly one of the most powerful laptops for gaming under Rs 60,000. Besides gaming, it will also be a great pick for anyone looking for a laptop for 3D rendering and video editing, and the RTX graphics can also easily run some of the small and medium-sized AI models locally. Amazon Echo Pop If you are yet to get an Alexa-powered smart speaker and don't want to spend a lot before exploring its services, the Echo Pop (review) is a great pick, especially at its discounted price of Rs 3,999. From its semi-sphere-like design to the ability to control smart devices and wireless music streaming support, it's easily one of the best entry-level smart speakers that money can buy. Available in multiple colour options like white, black, and green, one can pick a shade that matches the aesthetics of their home.",

    "description1": "There was a time when work and personal time used to be very distinct silos for us. But then the Covid pandemic and the resultant lifestyle changes impacted all of us like never before. But when work beckons you wherever you are — be it on a Vande Bharat train dissecting the Indian peninsula or a cozy courtyard overlooking the Kochi backwaters — you have to be sure the devices you have are able to take on the task at hand. Work is no longer an endeavour confined to the office environment. The new 14-inch Apple MacBook Pro powered by the M4 chip is made just for those times when you have to quickly work on a video edit wherever your passions take you. On the design front, the Apple MacBook Pro M4 does not come with any changes; it has the same look and feel, keyboard layout, and weight as the previous generation. However, I found the Space Black very stylish and practical for Indian conditions. It will also set you apart in a cafe where everyone else has older Silver Macs. The Magic Keyboard is well laid out like always and offers good feedback while typing; the trackpad is responsive to even the slightest of touches when you are trying to flick away a screen. That screen The 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR display is exactly what you need if working under the bright Kerala sun and it offers the right colour reproduction for you to ensure your photos and videos have the right hues in the final edit. The videos I shot on the iPhone 15 Pro Max as well as the Fujifilm X-S20 shone up on this stunning screen, even though I was not working under the best conditions at the resort we had for a family get-together near the backwaters in Kochi. The extreme dynamic range seen in most of the iPhone photos with my fascination for clouds comes out perfectly on this screen. And when the clouds give way to unseasonal November rains, the six-speaker sound system with four force-cancelling woofers and two tweeters makes you feel like you are listening to the new Pushpa 2 song drop on a Bluetooth speaker from some specialist European brand. Even more power The M4 has pushed the efficiencies of the M series even further. It is hard to figure out how much faster the new processor has made the MacBook Pro, given that even the M3 was more powerful than what most workflows demanded. But if you are among those working on the most power-sapping tasks, you will find everything happening a tad faster than before. And for those who have just these grueling workflows every day, this will make a huge difference. I airdropped about 16 4K clips from the iPhone and tried to merge them into one long video file. And it took about 40 seconds for a 4-minute-20-second clip to be exported from this. Anything faster would, of course, be faster but won’t make much sense to most users. Remember, you can maybe do this on a MacBook Air too these days, but if you push on video editing you need the fans and cooling of the MacBook Pro. For those already working on AI models or 3D graphics, it",
    "description2": "might still make sense to opt for the models with M4 Pro or Max. Once Apple Intelligence rolls out to all users we should be able to see the power of the M4 to help solve problems on the device. New software features With macOS Sequoia 15, I loved how you can mirror the iPhone onto the MacBook Pro and get to see notifications or apps directly on the large screen. Just to underline, I have done these with some Android phones almost a decade back. Apple could have done much more here, like letting you drag and drop photos from the iPhone to the MacBook. Now you can open the photos app and airdrop the iPhone photos. Also, the ability to get apps to go full-screen would be a great feature to have. One reason I have been using a MacBook Pro for the past few years is the ability to connect to a TV for meetings using the HDMI cable. This port stays with the new MacBook Pro along with the first Thunderbolt 5, offering transfer speeds of up to 120Gb This means you can connect to high-resolution displays easily. Plus, you have a card reader and three Thunderbolt (USB-C) ports. For those on video conferencing all the time, Centrestage comes to the MacBook Pro and does a great job of keeping you in the middle of the frame at all times. This is great for people like me who have trouble sitting straight during calls, especially when the meeting is wandering off from its agenda. However, I thought the 12MP could have done better in low light. Better power management, more power With all the improvements in processing power on the M4, the real achievement has been how the MacBook Pro manages over 24 hours on a full charge. Remember, this is with a better, brighter display. It is fascinating how even four generations since the M series launched the rest of the computing world is playing catchup on battery life. Should you buy it? Every year when a new MacBook comes out I get questions from regular users, much like me, asking if it is time for them to upgrade. My answers have started changing over the past couple of years. With the MacBook Pro powered by the new M4, I am not sure if this makes sense for the average user, especially now when MacBook Airs too are powered by M series chips. But if you do anything creative that needs a lot of processing like video editing, 3D modeling, or even top-end gaming, there is nothing better out there. And given how much stress you are planning to offload on the device, you have the option of choosing the chipset that can manage your workload. With prices starting at Rs 1,69,900, the MacBook Pro M4 now stands tall as the most powerful laptop you can own. If you are on a MacBook that is still running on Intel chips, it is a no-brainer to upgrade now, since the promise of AI is closer than ever before. Apple Macbook Pro M4 Pros Cons Superb processing power The camera is not great in low light 24-hour battery life Design is same as before Stunning display and audio Could have done more with iPhone mirroring Sleek design",

    "description": "Australia’s landmark social media ban on under-16 children could set a global precedent. ",
    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/11/social-media.jpg",
    "description1": "In an ambitious attempt to rein in big tech companies, Australia recently passed a law that bans social media access for children below the age of 16. The law was passed by the Australian Senate on Friday, November 29, with a vote of 34-19 after the country’s House of Representatives approved the first-of-its-kind legislation by 102 votes to 13 a day prior. As per the legislation, social media companies are liable for fines up to 50 million Australian dollars (Rs 275 crore approx.) if they fail to prevent children under the age of 16 from holding accounts on their platforms. Messaging apps, online gaming services, and platforms that are primarily used for health and education purposes are to be exempted from the ban. However, the law does not make an exception for age-restricted users who have the consent of their parents or carers. Here’s a look at what other countries have been doing to regulate children’s access to social media. India: While there are no specific legal restrictions on protecting children from online harm, India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, has a higher level of requirement than age verification for processing children’s data online. It requires data fiduciaries to collect “verifiable parental consent” from parents of children under the age of 18. United States: The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), enacted in 1998, requires parental consent for websites to collect personal information from children under 13. Many companies responded by blocking access for this age group, leading to widespread age fraud. The Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) of 2000 restricted access to inappropriate content in schools and libraries, but critics argued it was a limited solution since children could still access all online content outside these settings, often blocking useful information. United Kingdom: The UK has no current plans for Australia-style restrictions. But digital minister Peter Kyle has said that everything is on the table when it comes to keeping people safe online and has launched a study to explore the impact of smartphone and social media use specifically on children. He said that regulator Ofcom must have regard to government priorities such as safety by design and transparency and accountability, as they enforce the Online Safety Act from next year. The act, which sets tougher standards for social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and TikTok - including on appropriate age restrictions - was passed in 2023 by the previous government. European Union (EU):",
    "description2": " In the European Union, parental consent is required for the processing of personal data for children under the age of 16, though the bloc's 27 member states can lower that limit to 13. Norway: The Norwegian government last month proposed raising the age at which children can consent to the terms required to use social media to 15 years from 13 years currently, although parents would still be permitted to sign off on their behalf if they are under the age limit. The centre-left government also said it had begun work on legislation to set an absolute legal minimum age limit for social media use, but it was not immediately clear when a law mandating this may reach parliament. Half of Norway's nine-year-olds use some form of social media, according to the government. France: In 2023, France passed a law requiring social platforms to obtain parental consent for minors under 15 to create accounts. However, local media say technical challenges mean it has not yet enforced. In April, a panel commissioned by President Emmanuel Macron recommended stricter rules, including banning cellphones for children under 11 and internet-enabled phones for those under 13. It is unclear when new legislation could be adopted and to what extent it would follow the experts' recommendations. Germany: Officially, minors between the ages of 13 and 16 are allowed to use social media in Germany only if their parents give consent. There are currently no plans to go further. However, child protection advocates say controls are insufficient and call for existing rules to be better implemented. Belgium: In 2018, Belgium enacted a law requiring children to be at least 13 years old to create a social media account without parental permission. Netherlands: While the Netherlands doesn't have any laws regarding a minimum age for social media use, the government did ban mobile devices in classrooms from January 2024 to reduce distractions. Exceptions apply for digital lessons, medical needs or disabilities. Italy: In Italy, children under the age of 14 need parental consent to sign up for social media accounts, while no consent is required from that age upwards. China: Last year, China's cyberspace regulator said children under the age of 18 should be limited to a maximum of two hours a day on their smartphones. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) said it wanted providers of smart devices to introduce so-called minor mode programmes that would bar users under 18 from accessing the internet on mobile devices from 10 pm to 6 am.

    "description1": "If you look around the market, you’ll realise that all your essential devices—whether smartphones, laptops, or tablets—now feature generative artificial intelligence capabilities. In fact, the race to integrate Gen AI began with ChatGPT, which quickly evolved from a must-have app to influencing hardware design. While there has been significant optimism around AI, with billions invested in the technology, we have yet to see an explosion of devices designed from the ground up with generative AI at the same pace as the technology was initially marketed. Sure, the adoption of Gen AI isn’t widespread, and only a handful of people actively use AI on their devices. However, that hasn’t stopped companies like Meta and a few high-profile startups from heavily investing in new form factors designed with Gen AI in mind from day one. And the best part? You can actually buy these devices from the market. Here are five such cool AI gadgets that aren’t smartphones or laptops. Ray-Ban Meta glasses Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses showcase the potential use case of Gen AI in a familiar and easy-to-use form factor. They look like regular Ray-Bans, aren’t bulky, and the AI functionality works seamlessly. The best part about these glasses is that they aren’t trying to be a face-computer but rather a complementary device to your smartphone. In fact, these smart glasses have been outselling traditional Ray-Bans in some stores across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, highlighting the growing consumer enthusiasm for such devices. Although they aren’t designed for augmented reality experiences, users can take photos, listen to music, and ask the Meta AI digital assistant for information about objects within their field of view. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the Ray-Ban glasses, like smartphones, is that Meta continues to improve them through software updates. Earlier this year, Meta began rolling out Gen AI features for the device and later announced several new AI capabilities at its Connect event in September. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses are a true AI success story. It is the execution that might have worked in favour of Meta. You can snag the Meta Ray-Ban glasses for as low as $239 during the Black Friday sale. Rabbit R1 When the Rabbit R1 was announced earlier this year at the CES tech show, the device seemingly came out of nowhere and captured the interest of both the tech community and the general public. The bright orange-coloured AI gadget, the R1, was positioned differently from smartphones, and based on early demos, its computer vision was praised, helping the device stand out in the market. The $200 R1 has a camera and dual mics, allowing it to record audio clips, set timers, or perform more advanced tasks like providing search results, making voice recordings, and streaming music. However, upon release, the devic",
    "description2": "e didn’t exactly have smooth sailing. It fails to outdo what a smartphone can already do. Since its release, the R1 has seen significant improvements, and the startup promises a much better experience with the AI gadget. Maybe the R1 isn’t perfect, but it does what AI can do on a device built specifically for artificial intelligence. Bee Bee is a new AI wristband on the market, but what makes it different from other smart wearables is that the device is built for generative artificial intelligence. The Bee may look like an ordinary connected smart band, but it functions via a connection to users' smartphones. It has dual mics that allow it to listen to and analyze people’s voice memos and conversations to provide summaries and to-do lists. The device understands 40 languages and can also be integrated with healthcare tools and people’s Google and Gmail accounts to help generate personalized summaries and action items. The wearable, which went on sale recently, costs $50, and those who want better memory or additional capabilities will have to pay a $15 subscription. Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Google’s flagship Pixel Buds Pro 2 aren’t just designed for listening to music—they also feature AI throughout. This is likely why Google uses generative AI as a core feature and a selling point for the Pixel Buds Pro 2. While the previous generation of Pixel Buds featured Google Assistant and the “Hey Google!” functionality, the new iteration also comes with Gemini AI. This gives the Buds access to Google’s new Gemini Live AI feature by saying \"Let's talk\" after activating the assistant with the wake command. Although the feature can be inconsistent, it gives the Google Assistant experience a more conversational, interactive feel and allows you to receive advanced search results read back to you through the buds. Google seems to be going all-in with the AI-powered features of its new wireless earbuds. While the technology may not be perfect, it promises an expanded use case for AI in wireless earbuds—going beyond what AI can do on a smartphone. Kindle Scribe (2024) When the Scribe debuted last year, it was Amazon's first e-reader with pen support. It’s a terrific e-ink tablet, though priced on the higher side. With the new generation of Scribe just hitting the market, Amazon is adding improved features that elevate the handwriting experience with the help of AI. The first, called Refined Writing, analyses all of your handwritten notes and converts them into something more legible. The second feature, called Summarise, looks at all of your writing and distils it into a one-page summary of the key points. The $399 Scribe is a new type of device—part e-ink reader and part tablet. From what Amazon has showcased, Scribe's AI-powered features do feel like first-generation integration, but they’re not an afterthought; they’re core to the experience.",

    "description1": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk’s lawyers have filed for a preliminary injunction against OpenAI and Microsoft in an attempt to stop them and other defendants named in the filing from engaging in alleged anti-competitive behaviour. Filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California on Friday, November 29, the motion for an injunction seeks to halt alleged illicit activities by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, president Greg Brockman, LinkedIn co-founder and former OpenAI board member Reid Hoffman, and former OpenAI board member and Microsoft VP Dee Templeton. In the motion for an injunction, Musk’s lawyers alleged that OpenAI discouraged investors from funding its rivals such as the Tesla CEO’s AI company called xAI. “Musk has verified that at least one major investor in OpenAI’s October funding round has subsequently declined to invest in xAI,” the document read. It also alleges that the sharing of proprietary information and resources between OpenAI and its biggest investor, Microsoft, is illegal and amounts to “self-dealing,” which is harming marketplace competition. Additionally, the motion accuses the defendants o",
    "description2": "f having OpenAI throw business to organisations in which they have “material financial interests\". It notes, for example, that OpenAI chose Stripe as its payment processor to benefit Altman who has stakes in the platform. OpenAI’s bid to transition to a for-profit company was also challenged by Musk’s lawyers in the motion for an injunction. “No objective observer can look at OpenAI today and say it bears any resemblance whatsoever to what it promised to be,” the filing read. “An injunction to preserve what is left of OpenAI’s nonprofit character, free from self-dealing, is the only appropriate remedy. If not, the OpenAI promised to Musk and the public will be long gone by the time the court reaches the merits,” it further stated. “Elon’s fourth attempt, which again recycles the same baseless complaints, continues to be utterly without merit,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. In February, Musk sued OpenAI for allegedly abandoning its original nonprofit mission of making the benefits of its AI research available to everyone. The lawsuit was initially withdrawn in July only to be revived a month later.",

    "thumbnail": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/11/google-pixel-9-pro-review.jpg",
    "description1": "My fascination with small phones is well-documented, and nobody is a bigger fan of the iPhone 13 mini than I am. However, the device has started to age, and I feel it’s time to move on, which I did recently with the iPhone 16 Pro (I also use the Pixel 9 Pro Fold frequently—and gosh, it’s gorgeous). Yet, I still crave a small phone, and I don’t think Apple has plans to revive the iPhone Mini series—at least not anytime soon. For now, I have found a new companion in the Google Pixel 9 Pro (it successfully became my secondary device for a couple of days). A flagship-grade small phone was long overdue, and the Pixel 9 Pro, as a device, is both exciting and frustrating at times. I’ll get into where the Pixel 9 Pro excels and where it falls short in my review. Google Pixel 9 Pro price in India (as reviewed): Rs 1,09,999 Small is beautiful The moment I got the Pixel 9 Pro out of the box, I was surprised by its size. The Pixel 9 Pro XL (which I recently reviewed, and you can check out the review here) was huge in comparison. The Pixel 9 Pro is compact and fits perfectly into any pocket—literally any pocket—and the good thing is that the screen doesn’t feel small at all. I wouldn’t call it a tiny phone like the iPhone 13 Mini, which featured a 5.4-inch screen with tiny bezels and a reduced notch. The Pixel 9 Pro, on the other hand, has a 6.3-inch, 120 Hz, LTPO OLED display with up to 3,000 nits of brightness. The display is super bright and fast, with only small bezels and a single camera cut-out. After two weeks of using the phone, the screen feels normal. Honestly, while using the iPhone 13 Mini, it was always imprinted in my mind that it was a small phone and thus came with its shortcomings. That isn’t the case with the Pixel 9 Pro. As I mentioned, the 6.3-inch display is respectable in size—not as small as the 5.4-inch screen on the iPhone 13 Mini but still relatively compact. This is particularly small compared to today’s average smartphones, where a 6.8-inch display has become the standard. What impressed me about the Pixel 9 Pro, as with the iPhone 13 Mini, is how comfortable it is for one-handed use. I can easily take the phone out of my pocket and operate it with one hand. I know the struggle of holding a big phone while trying to shoot a video or take a photograph. I can also type a message with one hand while standing in a crowded place. The advantages of a small phone are there, and you need to embrace the size. The Pixel 9 Pro was made with the intention of being a premium flagship smartphone, and it shows in its design. I think it’s one of the best-looking high-end smartphones on the market and possibly the best small phone out there. Period. My review unit came in a lighter shade of pink (called Rose Quartz, by the way), and it’s pleasing to the eye, though I would have loved to see Google experiment with bold and fun colours similar to what Apple did with the new iMac. The screen is flat, while the body of the Pixel 9 Pro is square-ish with rounded corners, reminiscent of recent iPhones. The camera array on the back now features a raised oval island. It’s a controversial design—some might like it, while others may hate it. It protrudes quite far from the back of the phone, making a case necessary to protect the device. Additionally, I must note that it’s a very slippery phone due to the choice of materials and finish. That being said, the device feels expensive in the hand and has a Pixel-esque aesthetic, which matters a lot when Google is charging a premium for a phone like this. The camera triumphs The Pixel’s camera holds its ground to this day, even when smartphone cameras, in general, are fairly good across all models—no matter which device you pick up at any price point—and computational photography has become an integral part of modern phone camera design. However, I still feel that Google has an edge, and its Pixel phones still produce my favourite photographs. The Pixel 9 Pro has a triple-camera setup: a 50MP 1 sensor with an f aperture, a 48MP 1 sensor with a slightly improved f aperture (up from f on the Pixel 8 Pro), and a 12mm equivalent focal length. The telephoto camera also features a 48MP 1 sensor with an f aperture and a 5x optical zoom, with an equivalent focal length of 110mm. Many people don’t even know the camera specs, and it’s fair not to place too much emphasis on camera hardware. However, you need the best possible combination of camera hardware and software to achieve photographs that are less dramatic, true to the subject and have the sharpness and clarity that make each photo stand out as if you were part of the scene. The more I tried the Pixel 9 Pro’s camera, the better I was able to distinguish where the Pixel camera excels and where its shortcomings lie when compar",
    "description2": "ed to the iPhone 16 Pro’s camera, which also has its share of highs and lows. Not many may admit it, but it's important to highlight this as a reviewer. The Pixel 9 Pro is better at highlighting shadows, and skin tones generally appear more colour-accurate than on the iPhone. However, there are times when the Pixel reduces warm tones in a picture, and the colour auto-corrects too much. On the iPhone 16 Pro, I found that Apple has improved the phone’s 5X telephoto lens, and images appear sharper in low light. The Pixel also excels in video quality (the Pixel 9 Pro now offers 8K video recording using the Video Boost feature) and is particularly good at taking panoramas. However, the iPhone remains superior in overall video performance. That being said, the Pixel 9 Pro’s camera system is excellent and second to none (for example, the night mode is very impressive, as is the portrait mode), but it has its own flair and quirks that you won’t find on any other smartphone. It’s good to see the new selfie camera on the Pixel 9 series, which offers slightly more detailed images. You can use the Portrait option to create a shallow depth-of-field effect, although this has resulted in less realistic edges in my testing. Likeable performance, but the Pixel 9 Pro’s battery life surprised me Like other devices in the Pixel 9 series, the Pixel 9 Pro (my unit came with 256GB of storage and 16GB of RAM) uses the latest in-house produced Google chip: the G4. I am not into benchmarking and have no interest in comparing raw specs; all I care about is how the device feels on a day-to-day basis. The G4 feels powerful in regular everyday tasks such as browsing, social media, taking photos, navigating, and accessing apps. I found the phone to be much more capable of gaming, which surprised me. I did not notice the phone getting warm, as was the case with previous generations of Pixel devices. This is surely an improvement, as is the battery life. I was expecting the Pixel 9 Pro’s 4,700mAh battery to last as long as the iPhone 13 Mini in battery life, and to my surprise, the phone was able to last throughout the day, especially on days when I was out and had heavy app usage. When I got back home on those days, I found my phone with at least 15 to 20 per cent battery life left. However, don’t expect the battery life to last for two full days of use and even compare the Pixel 9 Pro to the Pixel 9 Pro XL and iPhone 16 Pro Max in terms of battery life. Android 15 and Pixel AI: A mixed bag The Pixel 9 series recently received an update to Android 15, and honestly, the latest software update brought very few new features. It's neither exciting nor does it alter the interface, which I feel has already started to stagnate. However, if you ask me, only two new features in Android 15 stand out: a) Private Space, which allows users to create a password-protected area within the phone for any apps or documents they might want to keep hidden. However, it’s not as user-friendly as I’d hoped. You need to sign in separately and re-download any apps you've installed in the \"public\" part of your phone, and it's not always clear how to hide certain files. b) The new Theft Detection feature is cool; it recognizes if your phone is snatched from your hand and instantly locks your screen to stop the thief from accessing your personal information. AI is a big part of the Pixel 9 Pro, and I have written in the past about how generative artificial intelligence features are more of a novelty at the moment and not as truly useful as Google wants users to believe. However, there are a few Google AI features that I found genuinely useful, such as the live transcription feature, which I feel is better than Apple’s AI. I also like Pixel Studio for creating generative AI pictures, and I use it frequently. However, I don’t use Gemini Live much; instead, I simply search the web. Should you buy the Google Pixel 9 Pro? I think it all depends on whether you need a smartphone with a small form factor. The Pixel 9 Pro is as capable as the Pixel 9 Pro XL because the hardware is exactly the same, with the only differences being the smaller screen and battery on the Pixel 9 Pro. I’m genuinely happy to be using the Pixel 9 Pro; it feels like a true flagship smartphone that is designed for small phone lovers like myself, and that is also its main selling point—of course, the camera is excellent. For me, though, the Pixel 9 Pro remains a superb smartphone—one of the best compact smartphones you can buy today.

    "description1": "Every time I attend a press launch event, a product briefing, or an interview, I make sure to carry my Moleskine reporter's notebook. It’s an integral part of what I do, and I’m sure my fellow journalists can relate to this. I often joke that you’re not a journalist if you don’t carry a notepad with you. However, as a tech journalist writing about personal technology for a living, I also try to review new products and incorporate them into my daily routine to see how I can benefit from them. Recently, I had the opportunity to try out the new iPad mini, and honestly, what intrigued me more than the usual features associated with the iPad was the idea that I could replace my pen and notebook with it. As I began using the iPad mini almost daily, I started to appreciate the device more. Reporting isn’t just about observing; it’s also about understanding the world around you. Apple’s little tablet serves not only as a tool for taking notes but also as a dictaphone, an AI assistant, and a camera, all rolled into one. Perhaps an integral part of my job is to share what I observe, and the iPad mini represents a new form of a reporter’s notebook as it embodies the accountability that comes with being a journalist. Here’s my review of the iPad mini. Apple iPad mini price in India: Rs 49,900 onwards (excludes the cost of Apple Pencil Pro) How I use the iPad I have been using the iPad for over a decade now, and I’m happy to be called a seasoned iPad user. There was a time when I switched to the iPad completely, totally replacing my Mac, and that phase lasted for a few years—until the M1 Mac came out, at which point I went back to using the Mac. I wouldn’t say I have an on-and-off relationship with the iPad. I still use it a lot, but not necessarily as a Mac replacement, as much as Apple would like me to. Instead, I enjoy taking notes on the iPad with the Apple Pencil, recording voice notes during product briefings, attending video calls, listening to music on Apple Music, and sometimes playing games. Honestly, I neither recommend buying the iPad Pro for these activities, nor would I want to spend that much money just to stream a Netflix show on it. I’m not into coding or making music, so I don't see the need for the iPad Pro or a premium tablet. It took me a while to figure out which iPad works for me, and considering I already use a Mac for computing tasks and the iPhone for phone-related activities, the iPad mini stands out for the things I want to do on a tablet. My love for dedicated devices If you ever peek into my tote bag and wonder why I carry so many different devices: an iPhone, an iPad, an iPod, a Nintendo Switch, a MacBook, a Kindle 3rd generation and a Samsung Galaxy camera. This is who I am; I’m a bit weird—someone who still listens to music on an iPod and uses wired earbuds. I like dedicated devices for different purposes, and I don’t regret that choice. I don’t believe a single device can replace every other device on the market. Maybe that's why I chose the iPad mini over the other iPads. It feels different, excels in one or two areas, and looks like what a tablet should be. This is the only iPad in Apple’s product portfolio that stays true to the original iPad. Small and compact I’m glad that Apple didn’t market the iPad mini as a computer like it did with the iPad Air and iPad Pro. The essence of the iPad mini lies in its small, compact footprint and its simplicity as a tablet. I’m sure you get that feeling when you pick up the mini. The 8-inch screen makes it just the right size for me to hold while lying on my back in bed, though I would say it isn’t as light as a Kindle. In terms of size, the Mini has been wonderful. It’s small enough that I can tuck it into a tote bag when I take public transportation or Uber, and it slides into even a stuffed backpack. It’s extremely lightweight (even with a protective case), which makes it a dream to travel with. That’s what I love about the iPad mini: you know it’s a tablet, and the Mini’s design and form make that clear. If you need an iPad for reading eBooks or taking notes, the Mini is the perfect choice. I didn’t get the same feeling when I was using the new iPad Air (the one with the 12.9-inch display)—the bulkier external keyboard doesn’t really suit a device as small as this. However, with the iPad mini, the design is intentional: you know it doesn’t support a Magic Keyboard, so you already understand its best use case. In my case, I use the Mini as a notebook replacement and jot down notes with the Apple Pencil. I also carry the Mini during interviews, keeping it on the table to record live transcriptions with Voice Notes. My life is sorted. The Mini features the flat-sided design of the iPad Pro, which I really like. That flat side enables support for the USB-C Apple Pencil as well as the Apple Pencil Pro (more on that later), which attaches magnetically to the side of the iPad and charges inductively. However, there’s no support for Face ID, as biometric authentication occurs via Touch ID integrated into the wake/sleep button on the edge of the iPad. The iPad mini offers a slightly less capable USB-C port and lacks the Thunderbolt port found on the iPad Pro. But nothing detracts from how the Mini feels as a device, because its purpose is well defined—what a small tablet can possibly do. The right screen size The screen display was a big selling point for me when switching to the iPad mini. First, the 8.3-inch screen size is just right for me—somewhere between the iPhone 16 Pro’s 6.3 inches and the MacBook Air’s 13 inches. Second, the screen size allows me to read eBooks on the go, which I’m not as comfortable doing on the iPad Air’s 12.9-inch screen. Finally, the Mini’s size and screen are perfect for taking notes. However, the iPad mini lacks a ProMotion display or an OLED display. I do feel that Apple could have included a high-refresh-rate",
    "description2": " display on the Mini. That would have been great, especially since many people who pick up this device likely intend to use it as an eBook reader or for gaming. I paired a keyboard with the Mini Apple has gotten a lot right with the iPad mini, but there is a caveat I must admit, as a fan of compact devices. The more you use the Mini, the more you realise that the on-screen keyboard isn’t great. The small form factor limits its usability for writing beyond a certain point. The landscape keyboard is cramped, while the portrait keyboard feels too large. Overall, the on-screen keyboard doesn’t provide a satisfying experience. That's why I paired an external keyboard for typing, which has greatly elevated my writing experience. However, you’ll never be completely satisfied. I have been using a mechanical keyboard with the Mini, and so far, the experience has been great. But I wouldn’t want to completely switch from my Mac. That being said, it doesn’t stop the Mini from being a capable portable writing machine when paired with a great keyboard. I have figured out how to write more effectively on the iPad mini and how to do it. That’s a fun aspect of using the iPad mini, or any iPad in general. I can try new keyboards and accessories to find what works for me. The do-it-yourself (DIY) approach is fantastic because it gives you the freedom to explore new ways of using a device despite certain shortcomings. A powerful processor and support for Apple Intelligence But the Mini feels like a powerful device with plenty of capability for the tasks it is designed for. The new Mini has been upgraded to the A17 Pro chip (the same one found in the iPhone 15 Pro). Scrolling through LinkedIn, reading newspapers, and visiting websites all worked just fine. I have also used the Mini as an eBook reader by firing up the Kindle app, and the device felt great. I'm not someone who will use the Mini for extraordinary tasks because I have a Mac for that. I know what type of user I am and why I’m so inclined toward the iPad mini. This understanding helps me appreciate the Mini better and see what it can do for me. The Mini also supports the brand-new Apple Intelligence (I tested a beta version; the public rollout might take a little longer, likely in early 2025 for India) on top of iPadOS. I have been using Apple's AI system for months since it was announced back in June, and my take on Apple getting into generative artificial intelligence is something I have been saying for a long time: it's familiar and helpful, but not out of this world. There are some features that are generally useful, such as writing tools that make your emails sound more professional and AI-powered audio transcription in the Voice Memos and Notes apps. I am already using the AI audio transcriptions in Voice Memos, and I can't tell you how helpful they are. This feature was long overdue and aligns perfectly with the iPad mini more than with any other device. Recently, I interviewed a developer on a video call using the iPad mini, recorded the conversation on the device itself, and used the Voice Memos app’s built-in ability to transcribe the entire interview into text. I then pasted the text into Google Docs, writing a copy on the Mini using the external keyboard. That’s my unique use case for the iPad mini. The note-taking ability is a standout feature Perhaps the primary reason I was so enamoured with the iPad mini is its note-taking capability. In my case, the device that comes closest to replacing a Moleskine reporter's notebook is the iPad mini. Its small size, the quality of the screen, and the ability to use the Apple Pencil Pro (the one I use for taking notes) transform the Mini into a writing and sketching device. My handwriting is awful (and only I can understand it), but I never stopped writing on paper. Sure, I may not be an artist or the best person to review the new Apple Pencil Pro, but I appreciate what Apple has done with this advanced stylus. The pencil’s haptic feedback dramatically improves the double-tap gesture and enhances the new squeeze gesture that brings up a contextual menu. There’s so much to love about the Pencil Pro, but I must say that as I use it more to take notes, I’ve realised just how bad my handwriting is. The good thing is that I still haven’t stopped writing or jotting down notes, and the Pencil Pro is helping me improve my handwriting—just one step at a time. Mini vs. Pro I brought up this question for a reason, and the answer lies in a simple fact: the iPad mini is a tablet and thus can’t replace your Mac. The iPad Pro is absolutely a beast and can come close to replacing the Mac, but it all depends on what type of user you are. I never tried to do Mac tasks on the iPad mini because I know it can’t handle them. Instead, the iPad mini shines in the areas that truly define the iPad, complemented by its form factor, screen size, and support for the Apple Pencil. That being said, the iPad mini is not perfect, and there’s room for improvement. Perhaps there could be new creative ways to add accessories and enhance the experience without necessarily requiring beefed-up performance, as Apple has done this time. Unfortunately, Apple Intelligence isn’t really a solution to the iPadOS problems. The issues that users typically complain about regarding iPadOS and how devices like the iPad Pro have been held back don’t really apply to the iPad mini. That’s where I feel a distinction needs to be made, and the user interface needs to be reevaluated with the form factor in mind to make iPadOS feel much better and more fluid. Apple iPad mini (2024) Pros Cons Small and compact footprint 60Hz display Supports Apple Intelligence Front camera is awkwardly placed Compatible with Apple Pencil Pro Missing FaceID 5G compatibility Performance boost with A17 Pro Double the storage over predecessor Access to Center Stage for video calls &nbsp;",

    "description1": "What is the best Android tablet one can buy? For years, this has had just one answer, a Samsung Galaxy Tab. The Korean tech giant hopes to underline this for another year with its new Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra 5G, the tablet equivalent of its smartphone flagship. But is the new Tab S10 Ultra really worth the legacy it carries with it? I used it for a few days, and here is what I thought.

The tablet has a size that other companies don’t offer and is clearly aimed at those who need the larger canvas to capitalise on the S-pen's ability to take your creativity to a whole new level. Buy this is a large tablet and you need to be mindful of that, especially the wide, or long, orientation of the device. Thankfully, this tablet is so thin and light that it compensates for its size. I am used to carrying my iPad on trips and even the Apple tablet gets a bit hard to manage from an Indigo seat. The Tab S10 Ultra is much bigger and will only struggle more. In contrast, this is a great device to have on your office table or while you are lounging on the sofa at home to scribble down your thoughts or just consume the latest Netflix show on the stunning Samsung screen. In fact, I was impressed by the audio and video playback capabilities of the device, making it perfect for binge-watching a new show or just flipping through The Indian Express morning edition PDF. And contrary to what I said about the size, I would still stash this into my carry-on bag to watch a movie on the next flight to Mumbai. The audio playback is as powerful as a small Bluetooth speaker and can fill the room on a quiet day. The anti-reflection screen makes this a device with which you can take your reading to an outside cafe or the balcony of your beach resort. As always, the best part of getting a Samsung tablet is the S-Pen. I have been saying that Samsung devices are an S-Pen length ahead of the competition. The same is the case with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra where I found the S-Pen to have improved on its pressure sensitivity with a softer tip. The tablet makes more sense with the S-Pen. Take the stylus off its magnetic perch on the back of the tablet and you have a perfect slate to write on, es",
    "description2": "pecially when holding the tablet in a vertical orientation. The S-Pen glides on the screen capturing your handwriting perfectly. Here I was annotating PDFs and making notes for new projects with the S-Pen menu helping me make the choice every time I took to the pen. Over the years, Samsung has perfected the use of a stylus on the tablet with both hardware and software. There is a new aspect that is mindblowing in many ways. The Sketch to Image feature converts any doodle you create into a respectable painting. I finally got to see what all the doodles I have been working on since childhood would really look like if I had some actual artistic skills. This is also a good way to give wings to your ideas and will really interest a lot of users. With the Samsung Ultra Book Cover (which costs extra) this slate is powerful in more ways than one to become your primary computing device, taking charge of all your creative duties. This is also the first Samsung flagship device powered by a MediaTek processor, the Dimensity 9300+, and it has a bumped-up performance. The processor ensures that the device stays cool whatever you do, be it streaming for hours or playing a new game. Plus, you now have actual AI features rolling out into the device, which means the on-device computing power has to be top-notch at all times. The camera too has AI features like in the new Samsung phones and you can use it to move around some subject in the frame or erase it completely. The one aspect that did not impress me was the camera performance in low light as the images turned out too noisy. The battery life is impressive, especially given the thin frame of the device, and can last two full days of moderate use, especially if you are not using the 5G at all times. At a starting price of Rs 108,999 for the Wi-Fi version, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is undoubtedly the best Android tablet of 2024. Buy the pricier 5G version (starting at Rs 122,999) if you are always on the move. With the S-Pen and the new AI features, there is little the competition can do to come close to what this tablet offers. However, if you are already a Tab S9 user then wait for the upgrade as expected for the chip as this device is almost similar to yours. New users need to check out the size of this tablet before committing.",

    "description1": "The 10th edition of the Apple Watch, the world’s most popular timepiece, is now out. While Apple celebrated 10 years of the iPhone with the iPhone X series that ushered in a new design philosophy, there are no such big flourishes with the Apple Watch Series 10. Maybe it is not the right time, or perhaps the time is such that nothing new is waiting to be done. As a regular Apple Watch user, I was excited to a certain extent by the larger display on the thinner device and wanted to see if that would change my usage. Here is what I found. Compared to the Apple Watch Series 9 (review), you can see and feel the extra real estate. With some of the new watch faces like Flux, the screen is fully utilised. And with apps like the New York Times, the alerts are now more readable with the extra real estate. But I would have loved a few new apps that are making full use of these two extra millimetres and thinner bezels on your hand. Also, the Apple Watch is now a tad bit thinner than before. After wearing it for a day I realised that this might be the Apple Watch I can wear to bed without being irritated much — I am a light sleeper and keep blaming everything from an afternoon coffee to the type of bed linen for my lack of sleep. It also makes sense to wear the Apple Watch to sleep now as you have the new Vitals app, which uses overnight readings to give you insights into your health. So far it tells me everything is in range. The readings, however, start appearing only after you wear the watch to sleep for at least four-five days, one of the reasons this review took longer than anticipated. The polished titanium feel makes it stylish, especially with the blacks. You can use some of the ne",
    "description2": "w watch faces to make people notice your new investment. With WatchOS photos can be converted into watch faces via the phone too. I like this feature as you get the reassurance of family every once in a while during the day. However, I wonder if this taking the personal too public; but then we put family pics on the larger phone lock screen as well. Another aspect I found effective was the fast charging on the Apple Watch Series 10. My old charging dock by the bed has been giving me issues of late and I have come to realise that when I pick up the watch for use just before leaving for office, it is usually short of charge. Now, in the office, I put it on the Daily Objects Surge Max dock for a few minutes and get enough juice to last the rest of the day. This is a sea change from the time it took hours to charge the Apple Watch. For my regular use of the Apple Watch, to track my daily quota of 10000 steps, regular heart rate checks, and mapping with my insurance and health apps, the Series 10 does well. The new Vitals app is an added layer here and will keep tab even when I’m sleeping. For the past couple of weeks, I have been using the Series 10 for my daily usage, and I am more than happy with the performance and battery life, compared to the earlier Series 9. However, unless you are on versions before the Series 8, it will not make much sense to upgrade to this one as the changes will not be that discernible. For users of older Apple Watches, this is an upgrade at many levels from performance to screen size and battery life. At Rs 46,900, the best smartwatch has become better, though the upgrade this time makes more sense for those who have held on to the upgrade for longer.",

While it doesn't have control over iPhone settings or third-party apps like Apple's own Siri or other competitors' AI systems, Gemini can access and interact with various Google apps such as Maps, Gmail, Drive, and YouTube.\nThis ensures that users can quickly retrieve information and perform tasks like checking emails, finding locations, or managing fil",

    "description1": "\n\n\nVMPL\nNew Delhi [India], December 2: Galgotias University, reaffirming its commitment to fostering a student-centric learning environment, recently hosted a two-day event Supercharge' 24 powered by Apple. The event aimed to inspire and empower the next generation of innovators by providing students with unparalleled exposure to global app development trends, insights, and success stories. The event featured prominent app developers who shared their journey, passion for app development, and the transformative role technology played in bringing their ideas to life. Through engaging sessions, workshops, and interactive Q&A discussions, students had the unique opportunity to learn firsthand about the challenges and triumphs of these innovators.\n\nA harmonious blend of creativity and technology drives truly inspiring innovation.The theme found resonance all through the multitude of sessions at the event. Sandeep Ranade, Founder of Apple Design Award winning app NaadSadhana, while sharing his experience attributed the passion behind the creation of the app to his personal need to beat the time crunch from a busy IT career and practicing Hindustani classical music, gaining easier access to an orchestra with a mobile app with intelligent jugalbandis created dynamically in real time.\nIndie developer, Mustafa Yusuf - founder of productivity apps such as Tasks and Karo, emphasised that small problems can provide unconventional channels to manifest one's knowledge and skills to big ideas and bigger solutions. He believes that today's students are rightly positioned to leverage the opportunities that have been made available through program such as iOS Student Developer Program powered by Apple and Infosys at the Galogotias University and events like Supercharge' 24 to find their passion and translate them to successful apps that empower users. His app Karo received an honourable mention as the top featured app on the App Store, inspiring students to find their own such gateways to success.\n\n\nSpotlighting best practices of combining design and technology to create apps that touch people's emotions and bring focus on how the interfaces makes users feel and operate the app, conversations with innovators revolved around th",

A key theme that resonated with all students was on inclusivity allowing the apps to be accessed beyond the barriers of language, disabilities, locations, culture etc. The wide array of Apple products that enable users to unlock their potential and translate ideas to reality were highlighted throughout the two day workshop.\nFor students at Galgotias University, the experience was nothing short of transformative with many feeling motivated and equipped with fresh perspectives on leveraging technology to address real-world challenges. The event not only deepened their understanding of the app development process but also highlighted the importance of creativity, resilience, and adaptability in a rapidly evolving landscape. Reflecting on the event, one student shared, \"hearing the stories of these developers was incredibly inspiring. It gives me the confidence to pursue my own ideas and a deeper understanding of how technology can create meaningful impact. This event has truly changed the way I view my future in app development.\nThe impact of this event is profound and it aligns with Galgotias University's mission to nurture future-ready graduates by bridging the gap between academia and industry. By bringing global expertise directly to its students, the university is setting a benchmark for innovative, experiential learning.

    "description1": "\n\n\nSMPL\nNew Delhi [India], December 2: Sinking into a comfy mattress after a long, tiring day at work is a feeling of pure bliss. A truly comfortable bed isn't just about sleep - it's about that moment when tension dissolves and every muscle sighs in relief. However, this blissfulness tends to fade over time as mattresses grow weary. What happens when that perfect moment becomes increasingly elusive, and your mattress no longer cradles you to sleep but rather fights against you?\n\nThe tossing and turning. The constant readjusting. The morning aches that make one wonder if they slept at all. A bed that was once a sanctuary of comfort now feels more like a nightly compromise. For many, the solution seems to be tossing out the old mattress and investing in an expensive new one. However, there is a smarter way to reclaim that feeling of blissful comfort.\nWhat if it were possible to transform an existing mattress into the sleep sanctuary it once was, without the hefty price tag or logistical headaches? Modern sleep technology isn't about replacing the bed - it's about elevating it. More often than not, sleep discomfort can be solved without replacing an entire mattress.\nInvesting in a high-quality mattress topper not only alleviates pain and discomfort but also extends the lifespan of an existing mattress by an average of 3-5 years, at a fraction of the cost of a new mattress. Unlike replacing an entire mattress, adding a topper is a remarkably straightforward process. There's no complicated delivery or disposal to manage. Today's toppers are easily secure to the existing mattress with elastic straps, and their washable covers make maintenance effortless.\nThe evolution of sleep technology has led to remarkable innovations in mattress toppers. Memory foam that adapts to the body's unique contours, cooling gel that regulates temperature throughout the night, and specialized materials that provide targeted support - these advances have transformed simple comfort layers into sleep-enhancing solutions.\nUrbanBed's Cool Gel Memory Foam Mattress Topper combines the best of these innovations. At its core is a specialized memory foam infused",
    "description2": " with cooling gel technology, designed to provide the perfect balance of support and temperature regulation. The foam responds intelligently to the body's pressure points, while the cooling gel maintains an optimal sleeping temperature throughout the night.\n\n\nThe topper's design prioritizes more than just comfort. Its Antibacterial UltraFresh treated cover ensures a hygienic sleep environment, night after night. The anti-skid base, combined with adjustable elastic straps, keeps the topper securely in place, eliminating the frustration of shifting or bunching that often occurs with other alternatives.\nWhat truly sets this topper apart is its adaptability to different sleeping styles. Whether one sleeps on their back, side, or tends to shift positions throughout the night, the memory foam's responsive nature ensures consistent support. The German-engineered three-zone technology provides targeted firmness for different parts of the body, supporting the shoulders differently from the lower back and the hips differently from the legs.\nUrbanBed's mattress topper also comes with a 30-night trial period and a 5-year warranty, offering ample time to experience its benefits while ensuring long-term investment in better sleep. As sleep comfort priorities evolve, shifting towards wellness and mindful spending, a mattress topper is not just an addition to the bed - it is a practical choice delivering premium comfort without the hefty price tag.\nUrbanBed's innovative approach to sleep technology demonstrates how far the industry has come, from simple comfort layers to sophisticated sleep solutions that can truly transform one's nights. In a world where quality sleep is becoming increasingly precious, it's reassuring to know that better rest doesn't always require a complete overhaul - sometimes, it's about making smarter, more informed choices.\nFor more information please visit : https://urbanbed.in/products/memory-foam-mattress-topper\n[This article was written with inputs from Tejaswini Mittal ]\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by SMPL.

    "description1": "\n\n\nWashington [US], November 13 (ANI): YouTube is exploring the future of music remixing with a new AI-driven feature, allowing creators to \"restyle\" licensed songs for their Shorts.\nThe company has launched a limited trial of this feature, named 'Dream Track', which enables creators to use artificial intelligence to customize various elements of a song, including its mood, genre, and tempo, as per The Verge.\n\nOnce the user enters a prompt to guide the restyling, the AI generates a unique 30-second remix that can be used in YouTube Shorts.\nThe feature is currently being tested by a small group of creators, with access granted to those invited to participate in the experiment.\nTo use 'Dream Track', creators can select an eligible song, describe how they want to transform it, and then let the AI produce the reworked track.\nThe remixed soundtracks will be labelled with clear attribution to the original song and will also include a note that the track was altered using AI.\nYouTube has emphasized that the 'Dream Track' experiment will only feature music from artists who have consented to have their voices used by the AI.\n\n\nSome of the participating artists include Charlie Puth, Charli XCX, Demi Lovato, and J",
    "description2": "ohn Legend.\nHowever, at this stage, it remains unclear which specific songs are available to remix and which music labels YouTube is working with to facilitate the project.\nThe new feature is part of YouTube's broader effort to bring more creative tools to its platform, especially for creators who make Shorts--a format that has seen tremendous growth in recent years, as per The Verge.\nBy leveraging AI, YouTube aims to offer users a greater degree of flexibility in how they engage with music, enabling them to generate personalized soundtracks that align with their creative visions.\nReports from June, obtained by The Verge, also suggested that YouTube had been in talks with major music labels to obtain permission to use their songs for AI training purposes.\nThis move could potentially pave the way for a larger-scale rollout of AI-powered music customization tools, which would further revolutionize how users interact with music on the platform.\nWhile still in the experimental phase, 'Dream Track' offers a glimpse into the future of AI-assisted music creation, where creators can seamlessly blend original works with innovative new twists, giving rise to an entirely new genre of user-generated content.

    "description1": "WhatsApp will soon end support for older iPhone models, a report has said. Starting May 5, 2025, the messaging app will require iOS 15.1 or later to function which means users of older iPhones, which cannot update beyond iOS 12.5.7, will need to upgrade their devices or switch to a newer model to continue using WhatsApp.Which iPhones will be affectedAccording to a report by WAbetainfo, this change will only affect users with iPhones that are unable to update to the required iOS version. Those using newer iPhones or those who have already updated to iOS 15.1 or later will not be affected.“Currently, WhatsApp supports iOS 12 and later, but with a future update, the app will require iOS 15.1 or newer to work properly. To help affected users adapt to this change, WhatsApp is providing a five-month notice period, giving them ample time to update their devices if possible or consider alternatives if their hardware does not support newer iOS versions,” the report said.Which iPhones are affected The report says that a bunch of iPhones, specifically the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus, will be affected by the change. &mdash; WABetaInfo (@WABetaInfo) These iPhones were launched over 10 ye",

For users with newer iPhone models, those running an iOS version below 15.1 can update to the latest iOS release by opening iPhone Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update. Why WhatsApp is bringing this changeWABetainfo says that WhatsApp's decision to end support for older iPhones is driven by the need to leverage the latest advancements in iOS. Newer iOS versions offer updated APIs and enhanced technologies that are essential for WhatsApp to develop and implement new features. By discontinuing support for older versions, WhatsApp can optimise its app and introduce innovative functionalities that would be incompatible with outdated operating systems.“Additionally, it's easy to assume that WhatsApp has closely monitored the number of users still running older versions of iOS. Data may indicate that a significantly smaller portion of users relies on these outdated systems. WhatsApp can ensure that it provides a better overall experience to the majority of its users by focusing on newer iOS versions, while minimizing the impact on those who continue to use older devices,” the report added.",
