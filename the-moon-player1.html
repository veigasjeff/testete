        "description": "The Moon (2023) is a South Korean space survival drama film written, co-produced and directed by Kim Yong-hwa, starring Sol Kyung-gu, Doh Kyung-soo and Kim Hee-ae. The film follows the dramatic story of South Korea's first crewed lunar exploration mission and isolation in space. It was released theatrically on August 2, 2023. In the near future, South Korea's first manned mission to the moon ends in a tragic disaster when an explosion occurs on board. Five years later, a second human spaceflight is launched successfully but a strong solar wind causes it to malfunction. One astronaut, Sun-woo (Doh Kyung-soo), is left stranded in space. Facing another fatal catastrophe, the Naro Space Center turns to its former managing director Kim Jae-guk (Sol Kyung-gu) to help bring Sun-woo back home safely. The Moon was praised for its realistic portrayal of space travel, its suspenseful plot, and its strong performances. Critics also noted the film's strong emotional core, as it explores themes of sacrifice, hope, and the human spirit in the face of adversity. The Moon is a well-made and thought-provoking film that is sure to appeal to fans of science fiction, space exploration, and human drama. It is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it.",
